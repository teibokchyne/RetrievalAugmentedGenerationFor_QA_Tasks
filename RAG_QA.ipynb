Investing. This is a glaring omission.\\nHistory we teach, but not the part about the great march of capitalism and the\\nrole that companies have played in changing (and mostly improving) the way we\\nlive. Math we teach, but not the part about how simple arithmetic can be used to\\ntell the story of a company and help us figure out whether it will succeed or fail\\nin what it’s trying to do and whether we might profit from owning shares of its\\nstock.\\nHome economics we teach: how to sew, how to cook a turkey, even how to\\nstick to a budget and balance a checkbook. What’s often left out is how saving\\nmoney from an early age is the key to future prosperity, how investing that\\nmoney in stocks is the best move a person can make, next to owning a house,\\nand how the earlier you start saving and investing in stocks, the better you’ll do\\nin the long run.\\nPatriotism we teach, but we talk more about armies and wars, politics and\\ngovernment, than we do about the millions of businesses, large and small, that\\nare the key to our prosperity and our strength as a nation. Without investors to\\nprovide the money to start new companies that hire new workers, or to help older\\ncompanies grow bigger, become more efficient, and pay higher wages, the world\\nas we know it would collapse and there’d be no jobs for anybody and the United\\nStates would be out of luck.\\nIn the past five years, a tremendous thing has happened in what used to be\\ncalled the communist bloc, the countries behind the Iron Curtain. The citizens of\\nthose countries have risen up and overthrown their governments and sent their\\ncommunist leaders packing, in the hope that someday they can improve their lot\\nin life. Democracy is among the things they want, as are freedom of speech and\\nfreedom of worship, but up there with the Bill of Rights freedoms, they also\\nwant free enterprise. That includes the right to make things, sell things, and buy\\nthings in stores, the right to own a house, an apartment, a car, or a business,\\nwhich until recently, perhaps half the world’s population was not allowed to do.\\nThe Russians and the Eastern Europeans marched, demonstrated, held strikes,', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='organized, agitated, and fought as hard as they could to get the economic system\\nthat we have already. Many people went to jail for this cause, and many lost their\\nlives. Yet in our own schools we don’t teach the basics of how this economic\\nsystem works, and what’s good about it, and how you can take advantage of it by\\nbecoming an investor.\\nInvesting is fun. It’s interesting. Learning about it can be an enriching\\nexperience, in more ways than one. It can put you on the road to prosperity for\\nthe rest of your life, yet most people don’t begin to get the hang of investing\\nuntil they reach middle age, when their eyes start to go bad and their waistlines\\nexpand. Then they discover the advantages of owning stocks, and they wish\\nthey’d known about them earlier.\\nIn our society, it’s been the men who’ve handled most of the finances, and the\\nwomen who’ve stood by and watched men botch things up. There’s nothing\\nabout investing that a woman can’t do as well as a man. Also, you don’t get the\\nknack for it through the chromosomes. So when you hear somebody say, “He’s a\\nnatural-born investor,” don’t believe it. The natural-born investor is a myth.\\nThe principles of finance are simple and easily grasped. Principle number one\\nis that savings equals investment. Money that you keep in a piggy bank or a\\ncookie jar doesn’t count as an investment, but any time you put money in the\\nbank, or buy a savings bond, or buy stock in a company, you’re investing.\\nSomebody else will take that money and use it to build new stores, new houses,\\nor new factories, which creates jobs. More jobs means more paychecks for more\\nworkers. If those workers can manage to set aside some of their earnings to save\\nand invest, the whole process begins all over again.\\nIt’s the same story for every family, every company, every country. Whether\\nit’s Belgium or Botswana, China or Chile, Mozambique or Mexico, General\\nMotors or General Electric, your family or mine, those who save and invest for\\nthe future will be more prosperous in the future than those who run out and\\nspend all the money they get their hands on. Why is the United States such a rich\\ncountry? At one point, we had one of the highest savings rates in the world.\\nA lot of people must have told you by now that it’s important to get a good\\neducation, so you can find a promising career that pays you a decent wage. But\\nthey may not have told you that in the long run, it’s not just how much money\\nyou make that will determine your future prosperity. It’s how much of that\\nmoney you put to work by saving it and investing it.\\nThe best time to get started investing is when you’re young, as we’ll discuss\\nin more detail later.

Most business in the world is done by companies. The word\\n“company” comes from a Latin word that means “companion.”\\nThe formal name for a company is “corporation.” Corporation comes from\\n“corpus,” another Latin word, meaning “body,” in this case, a body of people\\nwho join together to conduct business. “Corpse” also comes from “corpus,”\\nalthough this has nothing to do with the subject at hand, since corpses are unable\\nto do business.\\nTo form a corporation is easy. All it takes is paying a small fee and filing a\\nfew papers in the state in which you want to maintain a legal address. Delaware\\nis the most popular choice, because the laws there are favorable to business, but\\nthousands of new corporations are formed every year in every state. Whenever\\nyou see an “inc.” attached to the end of the name of a business, it means that\\ncompany has filed the papers to become a corporation. “Inc.” is short for\\n“incorporated.”\\nIn the eyes of the law, a corporation is a separate individual that can be\\npunished for bad behavior, usually by the imposition of a fine. That’s the main\\nreason owners of a business go to the trouble of getting incorporated. If they do\\nsomething wrong and they get sued, the corporation takes the rap and they get\\noff the hook. Imagine if you borrowed your parents’ car without permission and\\nran it into a tree, how much better you’d feel if you were incorporated.\\nDo you remember the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska, when an oil tanker ran\\naground and spilled 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound? This\\ncreated a huge mess that took months to clean up. The tanker belonged to Exxon,\\nAmerica’s third-largest company. At the time, Exxon had hundreds of thousands\\nof shareholders who were part owners of the business.\\nIf Exxon hadn’t been incorporated, all those people could have gotten sued\\nindividually, and lost their life savings on account of an oil spill that wasn’t their\\nfault. Even if Exxon were found innocent, they would have had to pay the legal', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='bills to defend themselves—in this country you’re innocent until proven guilty,\\nbut you pay the lawyers either way.\\nThat’s the beauty of the corporation. It can be sued, as can its managers and\\ndirectors, but the owners—the shareholders—are protected. They can’t be sued\\nin the first place. In England, companies put the word “limited” after their\\nnames. This indicates that the liability of the owners is limited, just the way it is\\nin U.S. companies. (If anybody ever asks you what the “limited” means, now\\nyou’ve got the answer.)\\nThis is a crucial safeguard of our capitalist system, because if shareholders\\ncould be sued whenever a company made a mistake, people like you and me\\nwould be afraid to buy shares and become investors. Why would we want to run\\nthe risk of being held responsible for another big oil spill, or a rat hair in a\\nhamburger, or the endless variety of mishaps that occur in business every day?\\nWithout limited liability, nobody would want to buy a single share of stock.\\nPrivate Companies and Public Companies\\nThe vast majority of businesses in this country are private. They are owned by\\none person or a small group of people, and more often than not, the ownership is\\nkept in the family. You can find examples of private companies up and down the\\nblock on every main street in every village and town, and scattered throughout\\nthe cities of America and the world. These are the barbershops, hair salons, shoe-\\nrepair outlets, bicycle shops, baseball-card stores, candy stores, junk stores,\\nantique stores, second-hand stores, vegetable stands, bowling alleys, bars,\\njewelry stores, used-car lots, and local mom-and-pop restaurants. Most hospitals\\nand universities are private as well.\\nWhat makes these businesses private is that the general public can’t invest in\\nthem. If you spend the night at the Sleepy Holler motel, and you’re impressed\\nwith the place and how it’s run, you can’t very well knock on the manager’s\\ndoor and demand to be made a partner. Unless you’re related to the owners, or\\nthe owner has a son or daughter who wants to marry you, your chances of\\ngetting a share in this business are close to zero.\\nLook at the difference when you spend the night at a Hilton or a Marriott and\\nyou’re impressed with those places. You don’t have to knock on any doors, or\\nmarry anybody’s son or daughter to become an owner. All you have to do is call\\na stockbroker and put in an order to buy shares. Hilton and Marriott sell their\\nshares in the stock market. Any company that does this is called a public', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='company.\\n(Although there are more private companies than public companies in\\nAmerica, the public companies are generally much bigger, which is why most\\npeople work for public companies.)\\nIn a public company, you and your parents, your aunt Sally, or the neighbors\\ndown the block can all buy shares and become owners automatically. Once\\nyou’ve paid your money, you get a certificate, called a stock certificate, that\\nproves you’re one of the owners. This piece of paper has real value. You can sell\\nit whenever you want.\\nA public company is the most democratic institution in the world, when it\\ncomes to who can be an owner. It’s an example of true equal opportunity. It\\ndoesn’t matter what color you are, what sex, what religion, what sign of the\\nzodiac, or what nationality, or whether you have bunions, pimples, or bad breath.\\nEven if the chairman of the board of McDonald’s holds a grudge against you,\\nhe can’t stop you from becoming an owner of McDonald’s. The shares are out\\nthere in the stock market, being sold five days a week, six-and-a-half hours a\\nday, and whoever has the cash and pays the price can buy as many as he or she\\nwants. What’s true for McDonald’s is also true for the thirteen thousand other\\npublic companies in the United States today—a list that continues to grow.\\nPublic companies are everywhere, and they surround you from morning to night.\\nYou can’t get away from them.\\nWhat do Nike, Chrysler, General Motors, the Gap, the Boston Celtics, United\\nAirlines, Staples, Wendy’s, Coca-Cola, Harley-Davidson, Sunglass Hut, Marvel\\nComics, Kodak, Fuji, Wal-Mart, Rubbermaid, Time Warner, and Winnebago\\nhave in common? They’re all public companies. You can play the alphabet\\ngame, A to Z, naming a public company for each letter.\\nInside the house, down the street, around the school, and through the malls,\\nyou can’t help running into a large crowd of them. Nearly everything you eat,\\nwear, read, listen to, ride in, lie on, or gargle with is made by one.

The bus is insured by Aetna.\\nThe bus itself may be owned by Laidlaw, a company that runs the bus system in\\nmany school districts.\\nThe books in your book bag have likely been published by one of the publicly\\nowned book companies, such as McGraw-Hill, Houghton Mifflin, or Simon &\\nSchuster, the publishers of the book you’re reading right now. Simon & Schuster\\nis a division of Paramount, which until recently also owned Madison Square\\nGarden, the New York Knicks basketball team, and the New York Rangers\\nhockey team.

If you’ve\\ngot cable, it’s a good bet your cable company is public. Of the three major\\nnetworks, CBS was recently taken over by Westinghouse, NBC is owned by\\nGeneral Electric, and ABC is merging with Disney. Westinghouse, General\\nElectric, and Disney are all public companies, and so is Turner Broadcasting,\\nwhich owns and operates CNN and has agreed to merge with Time Warner.\\nYou can invest in Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune, and Oprah by buying shares\\nin King World, a public company that syndicates those three shows, among\\nothers. You can invest in The Simpsons or in Cops by buying shares in Rupert\\nMurdoch’s Newscorp. Newscorp owns Twentieth Century Fox Television—the\\nFox network—which in turn owns these two shows. Nickelodeon, Nick at Night,\\nand MTV belong to Viacom, the parent company of Blockbuster Video.\\nMost of the products advertised on TV are made by public companies. Many\\nof these ads are written and produced by public ad agencies such as the\\nInterpublic Group.\\nIt’s easier to rattle off one thousand names of big-time companies that are\\npublic than it is to name ten that are still private. While there’s no shortage of\\nmom-and-pop businesses that are private, when you get to the major leagues, it’s\\nhard to find a company that doesn’t sell shares to the public.

Being a shareholder is the greatest method ever invented to allow\\nmasses of people to participate in the growth and prosperity of a country. It’s a\\ntwo-way street.

Or if\\nthey don’t make things, they provide services for money. For much of human\\nhistory, capitalism was an alien concept, because the bulk of the world’s\\npopulation never got their hands on money. Over thousands of years, the average\\nperson lived out his or her life without buying a single item.\\nPeople worked as serfs, slaves, or servants, for masters who owned the land\\nand everything on it. In return, the workers were given free room in a hut and a\\ntiny plot of ground where they could grow their own vegetables. But they didn’t\\nget a paycheck.\\nNobody complained about working for zero pay, because there was no place\\nto spend it. Once in a while, a pack of traveling salesmen would come through\\ntown and set up a market, but a market was an isolated event. The kings, queens,\\nprinces, princesses, dukes, earls, and so forth, who owned all the property—\\nbuildings, furniture, animals, ox carts, everything from gold jewelry to pots and\\npans—kept it in the family. It wouldn’t have occurred to them to sell off a piece\\nof land, even if they could make a big profit and have less grass to mow. There\\nwere no “for sale” signs in front of castles. The only ways to acquire real estate\\nwere to inherit it or to take it by force.\\nIn many parts of the world, since the earliest days of Judaism and continuing\\nwith Christianity, business for profit was an X-rated activity, and lending money\\nand charging interest could get you kicked out of the church or the synagogue\\nand guarantee you an eternal spot in hell. Bankers had an unsavory reputation,\\nand people had to sneak around and visit them on the sly. The idea of benefiting\\nfrom a transaction, or getting ahead in life, was regarded as selfish, immoral, and\\ncounter to God’s plan for an orderly universe.

The concept of getting ahead didn’t exist.\\nIf you want more details about what life was like before there were markets\\nand before people worked for a paycheck and had the freedom to spend it, read\\nthe first chapter of Robert Heilbroner’s classic book The Worldly Philosophers.\\nIt’s a lot more fun than it sounds.\\nBy the late 1700s, the world had opened up for business with brisk trade\\nbetween nations, and markets were cropping up everywhere. Enough money was\\nin circulation and enough people could buy things that merchants were making a\\nnice living. This new merchant class of shopkeepers, peddlers, shippers, and\\ntraders was becoming richer and more powerful than princes and dukes with all\\ntheir real estate and their armies. Bankers came out of the closet, to make loans.\\nOur Pioneer Investors\\nThe history books give many reasons for America’s great success—the favorable\\nclimate, the rich soil, the wide-open spaces, the Bill of Rights, the ingenious\\npolitical system, the nonstop flow of hardworking immigrants, the oceans on\\neach side that protect us from invaders.

But behind the scenes, somebody had to pay the bills for\\nthe ships, the food, and all the expenses for these adventures. Most of this money\\ncame out of the pockets of English, Dutch, and French investors. Without them,\\nthe colonies never would have gotten colonized.\\nAt the time Jamestown got started and the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock,\\nthere were millions of acres of wilderness land along the eastern seaboard, but\\nyou couldn’t just sail there, pick your spot, clear a space out of the forest, and\\nstart growing tobacco or trading with the Indians. You had to have permission\\nfrom a king or a queen.\\nIn those days, the kings and queens ran the whole show. If you wanted to go\\ninto business in the royal lands, which was most of the land on earth, you had to\\nget a royal license, called a “charter of incorporation.” These licenses were the\\nforerunners of the modern corporation, and business people couldn’t operate\\nwithout a charter or a piece of somebody else’s charter.\\nReligious groups such as the Quakers in Pennsylvania got charters.

And once you\\nhad the royal permit to settle the land and start a colony, then you had to look for\\nthe financing. That’s where the earliest stock market comes into play.\\nAs far back as 1602, Dutch people were buying shares in the United Dutch\\nEast India Company. This was the world’s first popular stock, sold on the\\nworld’s first popular stock exchange, which operated from a bridge over the\\nAmstel River in Amsterdam. Crowds of eager investors gathered there, trying to\\nget the attention of a stockbroker, and when their pushing and shoving got out of\\nhand, police were called in to restore the peace. The Dutch spent millions of\\nguilders (their version of the dollar) for the privilege of owning shares in United\\nDutch East India, which today, with so many companies known by their\\nabbreviations, might well be called UDEI.\\nIn any event, the Dutch company took these millions of guilders raised in the\\nstock sale and used the money to outfit a few ships. These ships were sent off to\\nIndia and points east to bring back the latest Far Eastern merchandise, which was\\nthe rage in Europe at the time.\\nWhile optimists paid higher and higher prices for the shares of United Dutch\\nEast India, figuring the company would make them a fortune, the pessimists bet\\nagainst the stock through a clever maneuver called “shorting,” which was\\ninvented in the 1600s and is still being used by the pessimists of today. In the\\ncase of United Dutch East India, the optimists turned out to be right, because the\\nstock price doubled in the first years of trading, and the shareholders got a\\nregular bonus, known as the dividend. The company managed to stay in business\\nfor two centuries, until it ran out of steam and was dissolved in 1799.\\nNo doubt you’ve heard how Henry Hudson sailed his ship, the Half Moon, up\\nthe Hudson River in what is now New York, looking for a passage to India, thus\\nrepeating the navigational mistake made by Christopher Columbus.

Columbus, we all know, got\\nhis financing from King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain, while Hudson\\ngot his from the aforementioned United Dutch East India Company.\\nAnother Dutch enterprise, the Dutch West India Company, sent the first\\nEuropeans to settle on Manhattan Island. So when Peter Minuit made the most\\nfamous real estate deal in history, buying Manhattan for a small pile of trinkets\\nworth sixty guilders (twenty-four dollars in our money), he was acting on behalf\\nof the Dutch West India shareholders.

The Virginia Company of London had exclusive rights\\nto a huge area that extended from the Carolinas through present-day Virginia and\\nup into part of today’s New York State. That company footed the bill for the first\\nexpedition to Jamestown, where Pocahontas saved Captain John Smith from\\nhaving his head bashed in by her angry relatives.\\nThe settlers at Jamestown worked there but didn’t own the place, a sticking\\npoint from the beginning. They were hired to clear the land, plant the crops, and\\nbuild the houses, but all the property, the improvements, and the businesses\\nbelonged to the shareholders back in London. If Jamestown made a profit, the\\nactual residents would never see a penny of it.\\nAfter seven years of nasty disputes and complaints from the settlers at\\nJamestown, the rules were changed so they could own their own private\\nproperty. It turned out not to matter at the time, because the original colony went\\nbankrupt. But there was a great lesson to be learned from Jamestown: A person\\nwho owns property and has a stake in the enterprise is likely to work harder and\\nfeel happier and do a better job than a person who doesn’t.\\nThe exclusive right to do business along the rest of the coastline from\\nMaryland into Maine was awarded to yet another English company: the Virginia\\nCompany of Plymouth. The way the map was drawn in those days, most of New\\nEngland was part of northern Virginia. When the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth\\nRock and stumbled onto shore, they were trespassing on property belonging to\\nthe Plymouth Company.\\nEvery schoolchild learns how the Pilgrims risked their lives to find religious\\nfreedom, how they crossed the cruel ocean in a tiny ship, the Mayflower, how\\nthey suffered through cold New England winters, how they made friends with\\nthe Indians and got their squash and pumpkin recipes, but nothing about the\\nremarkable story of how they got their money.\\nLet’s back up for a minute to review this story. The Pilgrims had left England\\nand taken up residence in the Netherlands, where the first stock market got its\\nstart—not that the Pilgrims cared about stocks. After several years in the\\nNetherlands, the Pilgrims got fed up and decided to move. They had three\\npossible destinations in mind: the Orinoco River in South America; a section of\\nNew York controlled by the Dutch; or a parcel of land offered them by the\\nVirginia Company of London.\\nThe one thing holding them back was a lack of cash. They needed supplies\\nand a ship, and could afford neither. Without financial help, they would have', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='been stuck in Europe forever, and we might never have heard of them. This is\\nwhen Thomas Weston entered the picture.\\nWeston was a wealthy London hardware dealer, or ironmonger, as they were\\ncalled in those days. He had access to property in New England and he had\\naccess to plenty of cash, and he and his pals thought the Pilgrims would make an\\nexcellent investment. So they made an offer they hoped the Pilgrims wouldn’t\\nrefuse.\\nWeston’s group, who nicknamed themselves “The Adventurers” even though\\nthey weren’t the ones going on the adventure, agreed to put up the money to\\nsend the Pilgrims to America. In return, the Pilgrims had to agree to work four\\ndays a week for seven straight years to make the colony profitable. At the end of\\nseven years, the partnership would dissolve and both sides would split the\\nprofits, after which the Pilgrims would be free to go their own way.\\nThe Pilgrims accepted these terms, because they lacked an alternative, and\\nbegan packing their bags. Then at the last minute, Weston turned the tables on\\nthem and changed the contract. Now, instead of having to work four days a week\\nfor the good of the business, they were required to work six. This would give\\nthem no free time to plant a home garden, or mend their clothes, or practice their\\nreligion, other than on Sundays.\\nAfter arguing with Weston and getting nowhere, the Pilgrims decided to set\\nsail without a signed agreement and without any travel money, because although\\nWeston had paid for everything so far, he refused to advance them another cent.\\nThey had to sell some of the butter they’d made for the trip so they could pay the\\nport charges and leave the harbor in the Speedwell, the ship they had outfitted in\\nHolland.\\nThe Speedwell leaked, so they were forced to return to port, suspecting all\\nalong that the captain and sailors were in cahoots with Weston and had\\ndeliberately sprung the leak. Most of them crowded into a second ship that was\\nsmaller and slower than the Speedwell—the Mayflower.\\nThey were crammed into the Mayflower, on their way to their promised land\\nin Virginia, when they drifted off course and overshot their destination.\\nRealizing their mistake, they tried to turn south, but the rocks and shoals of Cape\\nCod blocked their passage. Rather than risk a shipwreck in these unfamiliar,\\nrough waters, they dropped anchor in Provincetown harbor.\\nFrom there, they moved to Plymouth, where they built their shelters and\\nplanted their crops. With Weston having cut off the money flow, the Pilgrims\\nneeded a new source of cash. They worked out a new deal between another', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='group of investors (headed by John Peirce) and the Plymouth Company, which\\nowned the land.\\nThe Pilgrims would get one hundred acres apiece to use as they pleased.\\nPeirce would get one hundred acres per Pilgrim. On top of that, he and the other\\ninvestors would get fifteen hundred acres apiece for paying the rest of the\\nPilgrims’ moving expenses and for bankrolling the settlement.\\nAmong their many other worries, how to survive the winter, how to get along\\nwith the natives, and so forth, the Pilgrims had to worry about how to pay back\\nthe two groups of investors, Peirce’s and Weston’s, who had put up considerable\\nsums to carry them this far. As much as we like to think of the Pilgrims as\\nfocusing only on God, they had the same problems as the rest of us: bills.\\nAfter one year of the Plymouth colony’s being in business, the Mayflower\\nsailed back to England on a visit with an empty cargo hold: no furs, no gems, no\\ncrops, nothing the investors could sell. Plymouth was losing money and\\ncontinued to lose money season after season, or as they say on Wall Street,\\nquarter after quarter. This made the investors very upset, as investors always are\\nwhen they get zero return on their money. Worse than that, they had to send\\nmore supplies back to the colony, so the costs were going up.\\nBy 1622, Weston was fed up with Plymouth and supporting the high-cost\\nPilgrims with nothing to show for it, so he gave away his share of the business to\\nhis fellow “Adventurers.” Meanwhile, John Peirce was sneaking around the\\nother investors’ backs, trying to get control of Plymouth for himself so he could\\nbecome the “Lord Proprietor of Plymouth Plantation.” He didn’t get away with\\nit.\\nFor five years, Pilgrims and investors carried on their money dispute: the\\nPilgrims complaining about a lack of support and the investors complaining\\nabout a lack of profits. Then in 1627, the partnership was dissolved, with the\\nexasperated investors selling the entire operation to the Pilgrims for the modest\\nsum of eighteen hundred British pounds.\\nSince the Pilgrims didn’t have eighteen hundred pounds, they had to buy the\\ncolony on the installment plan: two hundred pounds per year. This was the first\\n“leveraged buyout” in American history, a forerunner of the famous RJR\\nNabisco deal of the 1980s that became the book and the movie Barbarians at the\\nGate. (In a leveraged buyout, a company is purchased with borrowed money by\\npeople who can’t really afford it.) The Pilgrims’ leveraged buyout was the first\\ntime in our history that workers took over the company business.\\nNow comes the most interesting part of the story. As soon as they had', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='established themselves, the Pilgrims decided to live in a communistic way: They\\npooled their resources and no individual was allowed to own any private\\nproperty. Governor William Bradford, the Pilgrim leader at the time, saw right\\naway that the communist arrangement would fail. He realized that without\\nprivate property, the people would have no incentive to work very hard. Why\\nshould they bother, when all the inhabitants of the colony got the same benefits\\n(food, housing, and so forth) whether they worked or sat around doing nothing?\\nA few farsighted residents of the colony petitioned Governor Bradford to set\\nthings up so farmers and fishermen were allowed to own their own farms and\\nboats and to make a profit from their efforts. In return, they supported the\\ncommunity by paying a tax on their profits. This free-enterprise system that\\nBradford put in place was basically the same as the one we have today.\\nBeing independent did not solve the Pilgrims’ money problems. In spite of\\ntheir hard work, the debt of the colony increased from eighteen hundred pounds\\nto six thousand. More Pilgrims were brought over from Holland to expand the\\nfishing fleet. Their hope was to pay off part of the debt with the profits from\\nfishing, but they never caught enough fish. For ten years, negotiations dragged\\non between the colony and its lenders, until the dispute was settled once and for\\nall in 1642.\\nThe Pilgrims helped build the social, political, religious, and economic\\nfoundation of modern America, but to the investors, they were nothing but a\\nbust. Weston, Peirce, and friends were the big losers in this venture, and they\\nwere no dummies, either, which goes to show that investing is a tricky business,\\nwhere the best-laid plans can often go awry. Or maybe they deserved what they\\ngot, for being so sneaky and underhanded, and for trying to renege on the\\noriginal deal.\\nThis is one instance in which the general population could be happy it didn’t\\nhave a chance to buy shares: The Pilgrims were not a public company, the way\\nthe Dutch West and East India companies had been. But there were other\\nopportunities for the European masses to get in on the New World bonanza, and\\nwith equally disastrous results. There was the ill-fated Mississippi Company and\\nthe South Sea Company, both of which appeared on the scene in the early 1700s,\\nselling shares to tens of thousands of gullible customers in the stock markets of\\nParis and London.\\nThe Mississippi Company was the pet project of a flashy wheeler-dealer named\\nJohn Law, one of the most interesting characters of his century. Law left his', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='native Scotland, after he’d killed a man in a duel over a failed business venture,\\nand moved to France. He wangled an introduction to the king, Louis XV, who\\nwas underage and left the royal decisions to a regent, the Duke of Orleans.\\nKnowing a royal family was the only way to get ahead in those days, and Law\\nconvinced the regent that he, Law, could solve the problem of France’s huge\\nnational debt.\\nLaw’s plan was for France to hire a printing press and print paper money,\\nwhich it could use to pay off the debt. Paper money was a relatively new idea in\\nthe world, and the regent was very impressed. So impressed, in fact, that he gave\\nthe immigrant from Scotland complete control over the Royal Bank of France,\\nalong with the royal printing press.\\nSoon, Law’s paper money was circulating everywhere. Almost overnight, he\\nwent from being a stranger in the country to being the king of French finance\\nand the wealthiest inhabitant of Paris next to Louis XV himself.\\nWith his popularity riding high in the opinion polls, or however they\\nmeasured it in those days, Law announced his second big project: the Mississippi\\nCompany. Its purpose was to bring back fantastic treasures from the vicinity of\\nthe Mississippi River. The Mississippi flowed through Louisiana territory, first\\nvisited by French explorers (Colbert, Joliet, Marquette) and later claimed by the\\nFrench. The French people back home thought Louisiana was another Mexico,\\nrich in silver and gold deposits just waiting to be carried away. Law himself had\\nnever been to Mississippi, or anyplace else in the New World for that matter, but\\nhe did a convincing sales job to make the public believe that the fantastic stories\\nthey’d heard were true.\\nLike fans at a rock concert, hysterical Parisians rushed into the maze of\\nnarrow streets near Law’s mansion. They had to apply to buy shares. Waving\\ntheir new French money, they fell over themselves trying to get Law’s\\nrepresentatives to accept their applications. The price of the shares rose and rose,\\nuntil Law’s company was worth more, on paper, than all the gold in circulation.\\nAnd still the buyers kept coming.\\nThere was hardly a person alive in France who didn’t catch the Mississippi\\nfever and dream of Mississippi gold that didn’t really exist. They had no\\ninformation whatsoever about Law’s company, other than what Law himself said\\nabout it, and there was no Wall Street Journal or Nightly Business News to tell\\nthem that Law’s scheme had no chance of success. In fact, whenever people\\nquestioned him or his company, they were shipped out of town, to distant\\nprisons.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='Whenever crowds of people bet their life savings on a hopeless proposition,\\nit’s called a “mania” or a “bubble.” The pattern is always the same.

After the Mississippi “bubble”\\nburst, and people realized Law’s company was a sham and Law himself was\\nnothing more than a financial Wizard of Oz, investors tried to unload their shares\\nand found no buyers. They lost their life savings, the French economy collapsed,\\nand the banking system collapsed along with it. As quickly as Law had become a\\nFrench hero, he became a French goat.\\nEngland had its own version of the Mississippi Company, the South Sea\\nCompany, founded in 1711. The organizers copied all their moves from Law.\\nThey promised to pay off England’s huge military debt if the English monarch\\nwould grant them a monopoly on trade with countries in the “south seas”—\\nparticularly Mexico and Peru.\\nIn 1720, the South Sea Company announced a new plan to lend the British\\ngovernment enough money to wipe out its entire national debt, military and\\notherwise, if the government would agree to pay 5 percent interest on the loan.\\nAt the same time, the company began to sell more shares of its stock. Half of\\nLondon headed for Exchange Alley, the hometown stock market, in their horse-\\ndrawn carriages, determined to buy shares. This caused a nasty carriage jam, and\\nthe streets were blocked for weeks.\\nThere was so much demand for these South Sea shares that the price tripled\\novernight, before the British Parliament had approved the debt deal.

But during bubbles such as this one, nobody listens to a lone voice of\\nreason.\\nWhen the word got out that the organizers of the South Sea Company had\\ngotten very rich by selling shares, other companies were quickly created by\\npeople who also wanted to get rich. There was a company for every wild scheme\\nyou could think of: a perpetual motion machine, salt farms in the Holy Land,\\nimporting walnut trees from Virginia, drying malt in hot air, making lumber\\nfrom sawdust, inventing a new kind of soap. One company refused to tell\\ninvestors what it planned to do with their money. It described its purpose as\\nfollows: “carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody can know\\nwhat it is.”\\nLords and laymen, merchants and menials, people from every profession and\\nevery rank in society got drawn into the London stock market expecting to strike', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='it rich. When the bubble finally burst, the English suffered the same fate as the\\nFrench. The price of South Sea shares took a nosedive, crowds of people lost\\ntheir life savings, and the British financial system was on the brink of collapse.\\nOne by one, the directors of the South Sea Company were brought to trial,\\nhad their estates confiscated, and were sent to prison, some in the infamous\\nTower of London.

(Dexter went public on its 201st birthday, in 1968.) At the\\ntime of the Revolution there was not one home-grown public company in the\\ncountry. The earliest to appear on the scene after the Revolution was a bank—\\nthe Bank of North America, founded in 1781. The Bank of New York (1784)\\nwas the first stock ever to trade on the New York Stock Exchange. It still trades\\nthere today.\\nThe Bank of Boston followed New York’s lead and sold shares, as did the\\nBank of the United States, whose main purpose in life was to figure out how to\\npay off the debts from the Revolutionary War.\\nIn colonial America there had been no banks, because the British didn’t allow\\nthem. We corrected this problem after the Revolution, but even so, there was a\\nlot of fuss about the federal government sponsoring a bank. Some of the\\nFounding Fathers, particularly Jefferson, distrusted bankers and their paper\\nmoney.\\nTaking their cue from their European ancestors, our earliest shareholders paid\\ntoo much for their bank stocks, and they knew very little about what they were\\nbuying. The bidding went higher and higher until it got to the level of ridiculous\\nprices, and on Wall Street, whatever goes up that high must always come down.\\nBank stocks landed with a thud in the Crash of 1792, the first crash in Wall\\nStreet history. As soon as the dust settled, the New York State Legislature passed\\na law, similar to the laws passed earlier in London, making it a crime to traffic in\\nstocks.

It is for taking this\\nrisk that people are rewarded so handsomely if they pick the right companies to\\ninvest in.\\nInvestors were very happy to own shares in the company that built the bridge\\nover the Charles River in Massachusetts. John Hancock was one of the founders.\\nThe sale of the Charles River Bridge stock was held on the eleventh anniversary\\nof Bunker Hill Day, in 1786. There was a parade across the bridge, complete\\nwith the firing of cannons, followed by a party at which eighty-three original\\ninvestors were treated to a banquet. It was a joyous occasion, followed by many\\njoyous years in which investors were paid a dividend.\\nThese steady dividends came from the tolls collected from the people who\\nused the bridge to get across the river. The customers of the bridge weren’t\\nnearly as happy as the investors in the bridge. Eventually, a second bridge, the\\nWarren Bridge, was built across the Charles River to compete with the first.\\nOnce enough tolls were collected to pay off the costs of building this second\\nbridge, the plan was to abolish the toll so people could cross the river for free.\\nThe owners of the original bridge objected to this plan, and filed a lawsuit that\\nwent all the way to the Supreme Court. They lost the case, and that was the end\\nof their profitable monopoly.\\nAnother successful company modeled along the lines of the Charles River\\nBridge was the Lancaster Turnpike in Pennsylvania. The Lancaster Turnpike\\nsold shares (through a lottery, as it turns out) and also paid a nice dividend.\\nAgain, the money came from tolls collected along this sixty-mile road from\\nPhiladelphia to Lancaster. The customers of this road didn’t like the tolls any\\nmore than the customers of the Charles River Bridge did, but they preferred\\npaying them to driving their buggies through fields and woods.\\nTurnpike, bridge, and canal companies were the forerunners of the trolley,\\nrailroad, and subway companies that came along a bit later.\\nThe Father of the Financial System\\nWe all recognize George Washington as the father of our country, but Alexander\\nHamilton was the father of the financial system. That part gets lost in the history\\nbooks, but without the financial system, the political system never would have\\nworked. Hamilton deserves the credit for this. He’s more famous for being a\\nlousy shot and losing a duel to Aaron Burr, but he was also an astute economic', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='planner and one of the founders of the Bank of New York.\\nHamilton realized that the country couldn’t get along without money, and to\\nhave money, it needed banks. It seems obvious today, but back then, banking\\nwas a controversial subject.\\nGeorge Washington agreed with Hamilton about the banks, and even invested\\nin one himself. Washington was a shareholder in the Bank of Alexandria, which\\nopened near his home at Mount Vernon. But a lot of important people were\\nopposed to Hamilton’s ideas, and foremost among them was Thomas Jefferson.\\nJefferson was a gentleman farmer who believed there was virtue in tilling the\\nsoil and living off the land. He hated factories and the cities that grew up around\\nthe factories. To Jefferson, banks were the root of all evil, especially the\\ngovernment’s bank.\\nAs it turns out, Jefferson was no expert on personal finance. He ran through a\\nlarge fortune and died virtually bankrupt in 1826. He was a big spender,\\nparticularly on gadgets and on books, and his library had more volumes than\\nHarvard College, which had been in existence for more than one hundred years\\nbefore Jefferson was born. He was a tinkerer, a bookworm, and a farmer at heart\\n—the gentlemanly kind who left the farm work to others.\\nJefferson wanted America to be a nation of pastures and wheat fields, where\\nindependent “yeoman” farmers could dominate local politics and have the\\nstrongest voice in public affairs. He rejected the European idea that government\\nshould be run by a ruling class of snooty aristocrats.\\nNever would Jefferson have imagined that the factories would lure millions of\\nfarm workers away from the farms and into the cities and the mill towns, or that\\nfactories would be their ticket to a better life, or that heavy industry with all its\\nproblems would provide Americans with the highest standard of living in the\\nhistory of human beings. It couldn’t have happened without the massive amounts\\nof money that went into building the roads, canals, highways, bridges, factories\\n—and where did most of this money come from? Jefferson’s dreaded banks!\\nIn spite of Jefferson’s opposition, the first Bank of the United States got the\\ncongressional go-ahead in 1791 and managed to stay in business for twenty\\nyears, until 1811, when a new group of bank haters in Congress refused to renew\\nthe charter. The bank was shut down.\\nA second Bank of the United States was chartered in 1816, this time in\\nPhiladelphia, but it ran into trouble a few years later when Andrew Jackson was\\nelected president. Jackson was a rough character who came from the wilds of\\nTennessee. They called him “Old Hickory,” because he was tall like a tree (six', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='feet one inch, which was very big for those days), he had a thick skin like a tree,\\nand he grew up in a log cabin. In spite of his outdoorsy reputation, Jackson was\\nsick most of the time and stayed indoors. Like Jefferson before him, Jackson\\nbelieved that the states should have more power and the federal government less.\\nThis second Bank of the United States was blamed for a nationwide financial\\npanic in 1819, when a lot of businesses went bankrupt and people lost their life\\nsavings and their jobs. (This was the first of a long string of panics, which\\ncreated havoc around the country.) Western farmers joined with eastern factory\\nworkers in waggling their fingers at the “monster bank” that they said was the\\nculprit of the panic.\\nSo when Jackson was elected president a decade after the panic, he listened to\\nthese people and took all the money out of the federally sponsored bank and\\nshipped it off to be deposited in various state banks, and that was the end of the\\nsecond Bank of the United States. From then on, the states controlled the\\nbanking business and gave out the charters. Soon, every John and Jane Doe with\\nnothing better to do decided to start a bank.\\nThousands of banks appeared on main streets and side streets in big towns\\nand little towns, the way chicken restaurants are cropping up today. And since\\nevery one of these state banks could issue its own paper money, it was very\\nconfusing to do business, because from state to state it was hard to tell whose\\ncash was worth what, and a lot of merchants wouldn’t accept any of it. Traveling\\nwithin the country then was very similar to traveling abroad today: You had to\\nworry about changing money from place to place.\\nThis is an area in which the United States and Europe have gone in different\\ndirections. Europe has always had a few banks with many branches, while we’ve\\nalways had a slew of different banks. By 1820, there were three hundred separate\\nbanks in the United States, as compared to a handful of banks in England.\\nToday, there are over ten thousand banking institutions in the United States, if\\nyou add in all the savings and loans and the credit unions, while Great Britain\\nhas less than fifteen.\\nMany of our local banks were shoestring operations that lacked the necessary\\ncapital to tide them over in an economic crisis, and there was always a crisis\\nwaiting to happen. Half the banks that opened their doors between 1810 and\\n1820 had failed by 1825, and half the banks that opened between 1830 and 1840\\nhad failed by 1845. When you put money into a bank, it wasn’t insured the way\\nit is today, so when a bank failed, people with savings accounts or checking\\naccounts had no protection and lost all their money. There was no such thing as a', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='safe deposit.\\nBanks were dangerous places to park cash, but that didn’t stop Americans\\nfrom putting their life savings into them. The banks would take these savings\\nand lend the money to the bridge builders and the canal builders, the turnpike\\nprojects and the railroad projects that got America moving. When a bank loaned\\nmoney to a railroad, or a bridge company, or a steel company, the money came\\nfrom the savings accounts of the people who put money into the bank.\\nIn other words, all this high energy, this excitement, this hustle and bustle that\\nled to economic progress was financed out of the pockets of the man and woman\\non the street.\\nWhenever the government needed money for a project, it had four choices of\\nwhere to get it: taxes, bank loans, selling lottery tickets, or selling bonds. (More\\nabout bonds on page 104.) Whenever a company needed money, it could borrow\\nfrom a bank, sell bonds, or sell shares of stock. But in the first half of the\\nnineteenth century, stocks were a company’s last resort. The idea of selling\\nshares to the public caught on very slowly.\\nThe Father of Modern Economics\\nMarkets were opening all over the place, and people were buying and selling at a\\nfurious pace, and to many people the whole situation was out of control. Never\\nin history had masses of individuals been allowed to go their own way and work\\nfor their own benefit. There didn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason to it.\\nThis is where the economists came in. They were a new breed of thinker. For\\nthousands of years, religious philosophers had tried to figure out how mankind\\ncould live according to God’s wishes. They debated politics and the best form of\\ngovernment, and who the leaders should be. But it took economists to describe\\nwhat happens when individuals have the freedom to seek their fortunes.\\nThe first and the smartest early economist was a Scotsman named Adam\\nSmith, a nerd of his day who lived at the time of the American Revolution.\\nSmith avoided parties and picnics to stay at home thinking and writing, and he\\nwas so absorbed in his ideas that he got the reputation of being absent-minded.\\nHis great work was called An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth\\nof Nations, which today goes by the shortened title, The Wealth of Nations.\\nThe Wealth of Nations was published in 1776, the year America declared its\\nindependence, and it’s a shame that Adam Smith didn’t get more credit for\\nwriting it. He deserves a prime spot in history along with John Locke, Benjamin', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='Franklin, Thomas Paine, and other revolutionary thinkers who argued that\\npolitical freedom is the key to a just society where people can live in peace and\\nharmony. The others didn’t say much about how to pay the bills—but Smith did.\\nHe made the case for economic freedom.\\nSmith argued that when each person pursues his own line of work, the general\\npopulation is far better off than it is when a king or a central planner runs the\\nshow and dictates who gets what. His point seems obvious today, but in 1776, it\\nwas a novel idea that millions of individuals making and selling whatever they\\npleased, and going off in all directions at once, could create an orderly society in\\nwhich everybody had clothes, food, and a roof over their heads. What if ninety-\\nnine out of one hundred people decided to make hats, and only one out of one\\nhundred decided to grow vegetables? The country would be flooded with hats,\\nand there would be nothing to eat. But this is where the Invisible Hand comes to\\nthe rescue.\\nThere wasn’t really an Invisible Hand, of course, but Smith imagined one\\nworking behind the scenes to insure that the right number of people grew\\nvegetables, and the right number of people made hats. He was really talking\\nabout the way in which supply and demand kept goods and services in balance.\\nFor instance, if too many hat makers made too many hats, hats would pile up in\\nthe market, forcing the hat sellers to lower the price. Lower prices for hats would\\ndrive some hat makers out of the hat business and into a more profitable line of\\nwork, such as vegetable farming. Eventually, there would be just enough\\nvegetable farmers and just enough hat makers to make the right amount of\\nvegetables and hats.\\nIn the real world, things don’t work out quite as perfectly as that, but Smith\\nunderstood the basics of how a free market works, and they still hold true today.\\nWhenever there’s a demand for a new product, such as computers, more and\\nmore companies get into the business, until there are so many computers for sale\\nthat the stores have to drop their prices. This competition is very good for you,\\nme, and all the other consumers, because it forces the computer makers to\\nimprove their product and cut prices. That’s why every few months, they come\\nout with fantastic new models that cost less than the clunky old models. Without\\ncompetition, they could keep selling the clunky old models and consumers could\\ndo nothing about it.\\nThe Invisible Hand keeps the supply and demand of everything from\\nbubblegum to bowling balls in balance. We don’t need a king, a Congress, or a\\nDepartment of Things to decide what the country should make, and how many of', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='each item, and who should be allowed to do the manufacturing. The market sorts\\nthis out, automatically.\\nSmith also realized that wanting to get ahead is a positive impulse, and not\\nthe negative that religious leaders and public opinion makers had tried to stamp\\nout for centuries. Self-interest, he noticed, isn’t entirely selfish. It motivates\\npeople to get off their fannies and do the best they can at whatever job they\\nundertake. It causes them to invent things, work overtime, put extra effort into\\nthe project at hand. Imagine what lousy carpenters, plumbers, doctors, lawyers,\\naccountants, bankers, secretaries, professors, center fielders, and quarterbacks\\nwe’d have if people weren’t allowed to profit from their talents, and success was\\nnever rewarded!\\nSmith said there was a “law of accumulation” that turned self-interest into a\\nbetter life for everyone. When the owner of a business got richer, he or she\\nwould expand the business and hire more people, which would make everybody\\nelse richer, and some of them would start their own businesses, and so on. This\\nis where capitalism created opportunities, unlike feudal agriculture, where a\\nsmall number of big shots owned the land and kept it in the family, and if you\\nwere born a peasant, you would live penniless and die penniless, and your\\nchildren and their children would be stuck in the same rut forever.\\nAt the time Smith wrote his book, and throughout the century that followed,\\ngreat thinkers were trying to find laws for everything. Scientists already had\\ndiscovered physical laws, such as the law of gravity, the laws of planetary\\nmotion, and the laws for certain chemical reactions. People believed in an\\norderly universe, in which, if there were laws for how the planets move and how\\napples fall from the tree, there had to be laws for business, and laws for politics,\\nand laws for how people react in different situations. Once you figured out the\\nformula for how money gets passed around, for instance, you could predict\\nexactly who would end up with how much.\\nIt was one thing to say there was a law of supply and demand, or a law for\\nhow money travels, and quite another to find a formula that could nail it down.\\nBut economists kept trying, coming up with new theories to reduce the hustle\\nand bustle of the marketplace to a single equation.\\nOur First Millionaires\\nAccording to the records, not a single millionaire existed in America in colonial\\ntimes. Elias Hasket Derby of Salem, Massachusetts, a seafaring merchant who', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='refused to get involved in the slave trade, was reputed to be the wealthiest person\\nin the country. Today, his house belongs to the National Park Service and is\\nopen to the public. It’s only a few hundred yards from the House of Seven\\nGables, the setting for Nathaniel Hawthorne’s famous book. The fact that\\neverybody knows Hawthorne and not Elias Hasket Derby tells you something\\nabout the relative importance of literature and finance in the schools.\\nSeveral hundred miles to the south, a Baltimore merchant, Robert Oliver, had\\nalso collected a sizeable fortune, but during and after the Revolution, the richest\\nperson in America was thought to be Robert Morris.\\nMorris formed a business syndicate that bought and sold ships. His ships\\nsailed from the West Indies to Europe and back again, sending tobacco and\\nfoodstuffs in the European direction and bringing cloth and manufactured goods\\nfrom them to us. He was chairman of a secret committee that supplied the\\nrevolutionary armies with coats, pants, shirts, and gunpowder, and his companies\\ngot the contracts to supply the army. Morris became superintendent of finance\\nunder the Articles of Confederation, and he was an avid supporter of Alexander\\nHamilton and of Hamilton’s pet project, the first national bank.\\nMorris believed that only the better class of people should run the country. He\\nargued for the superiority of gentlemen such as himself, for there was no doubt\\nin his mind he was one. He was entirely opposed to Jefferson’s idea that the\\nsmall independent farmer was the backbone of the nation and should be given\\nthe right to vote.\\nLike many of the great wheeler-dealers who followed in his footsteps, Morris\\nbuilt his empire on money borrowed from the banks. He had many friends in\\nhigh places, and since his biggest customer was the army, we could call him the\\noriginal big defense contractor.\\nAlso like some of our modern wheeler-dealers, including Donald Trump,\\nMorris overextended himself and borrowed more money than he could pay back.\\nThere was a lull in the shipping business, his financial empire collapsed, and\\nMorris declared bankruptcy.\\nIn those days, declaring bankruptcy was a very serious thing to do, because\\nowing money to people and not paying them back was a crime. Morris spent\\nthree years in a debtor’s prison in Philadelphia, where one of his visitors was\\nGeorge Washington. From his jail cell, Morris organized a campaign to abolish\\nthis sort of penalty, and thanks to his efforts, we no longer lock people up when\\nthey can’t pay their debts. If we still had debtor’s prisons in the 1990s, they\\nwould be very crowded, because more than eight hundred thousand Americans', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='file for personal bankruptcy every year. Most have gotten in too deep with their\\ncredit cards.\\nBy 1815, there were a half-dozen millionaires in the country, and most made\\ntheir profits on ships and trading. Number one among them was Stephen Girard\\nof Philadelphia, who died in 1831 at the age of eighty-two, the richest person in\\nAmerica at that time.\\nGirard was born in France, the son of a ship captain. He went to sea as a\\nteenager and later became an international trader and merchant. He came to\\nAmerica, invested in land, bank stocks, and government bonds, and managed to\\nprosper in all these areas. Girard eventually started his own bank and joined a\\nsyndicate to do business with a younger wheeler-dealer named John Jacob Astor.\\nMore on him shortly.\\nAt his death, Girard left an estate worth $6 million, a vast fortune at the time,\\neven though today it would barely pay a year’s salary for a top baseball player.\\nThe bulk of the money was donated to a college for male orphan children. Girard\\nwas a confirmed atheist who despised religion so much that under the terms of\\nhis will, no minister of any faith could set foot on the college property.\\nGirard’s net worth was eclipsed by that of John Jacob Astor. Astor was a\\nGerman immigrant who started out as a fur trader, then bought part interest in a\\nship that sailed back and forth to China—that’s where the big fortunes were still\\nbeing made, in ships and trading. From one ship, Astor expanded to two, three,\\nfour, and eventually he had a fleet of speedy vessels known as clippers. For an\\nAmerican to build a fleet of this kind was a major achievement, because it had to\\nbe done with borrowed money, and the American banks had a limited supply of\\nmoney to lend, as compared, say, to the British banks.\\nDuring this period in history, money was backed by precious metals, so the\\namount of cash a bank could print depended on how much gold and silver it had\\nin its vaults. In London, there was an ample supply, so the banks could roll the\\npresses and create plenty of cash for their business tycoons to borrow. But the\\nU.S. supplies of gold and silver were quite low, so the banks were often short on\\ncash, and Astor and his fellow capitalists had trouble borrowing enough money\\nto finance their grandiose projects.\\nWhen he realized he couldn’t beat the competition, Astor turned away from\\ninternational trade and concentrated on the U.S. market, where he did well\\nenough, because in 1848, when he died at the age of eighty-four, he left behind\\nan estate whose assets topped $20 million, roughly three times the estate of his\\nold friend Girard.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='Soon after Astor’s funeral and all the articles that came out about his great\\nwealth, people were furious to discover that his family inherited $19-plus million\\nand only five hundred thousand dollars went to charity. This started a hot\\nnational debate: If you can’t take it with you, who should get it? The public\\nthought Astor should have left more to his fellowman in general, and less to his\\nrelatives, because capitalists were supposedly working for the benefit of society.\\nThis debate still rages today. Everyone seems to agree that working hard and\\ngetting ahead is a good thing, but people are divided on the issue of what to do\\nwith the proceeds. These days, Astor couldn’t possibly have given 95 percent of\\nhis wealth to his children, because the estate taxes would have taken 55 percent\\noff the top as soon as he was laid to rest. The contemporary rich have a different\\nsort of choice: They can leave their money to private charities and foundations,\\nincluding colleges, hospitals, homeless shelters, AIDS research, and food banks,\\nor they can do nothing and let the government take the biggest chunk of it.\\nA Slow Start for Stocks\\nBy 1800, there were 295 corporations formed in the United States, but most of\\nthese remained in private hands so the general public couldn’t own them.\\nCorporations were very controversial. Their fans and supporters saw them as an\\nimportant ally of democracy that could benefit the community at large. Their\\ncritics saw them as undemocratic, sneaky, and subversive organizations that only\\ncared about themselves.\\nIt was a frustrating period for any investor in stocks. The states already had\\npassed laws to limit the liability of shareholders if a company got sued, so people\\ncould invest without fear of losing more than the value of their shares. But not\\nmany people did invest. It was hard to find friends or neighbors to share in the\\nenthusiasm and chat about their favorite public companies, the way investors do\\ntoday whenever we get the chance.\\nThere wasn’t a business section of the newspaper, or a Money magazine, or\\nbooks on how to pick stocks. In fact, there weren’t many stocks to pick from: a\\ndozen or so banks, a couple of insurance companies, a gas company or two, and\\nthat was it. In March 1815 the complete list was printed in the New York\\nCommercial Advertiser, a popular paper of the day. There were twenty-four\\nstocks, mostly banks. In 1818, there were twenty-nine stocks, and in 1830,\\nthirty-one.\\nThe earliest buying and selling was done under a large buttonwood tree on', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='Wall Street, and after that, stocks were traded in small rented rooms or in\\ncoffeehouses. At one point, there was a fire in one of the rooms, and the traders\\nmoved into a hayloft and continued trading there.\\nThe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) wasn’t what you’d call an exciting\\nhangout. You could stand around and twiddle your thumbs waiting for a stock to\\nbe traded. Business was so slow that the traders started buying and selling at\\n11:30 and were done for the day by 1:30. It got so dull that on March 16, 1830, a\\nprime candidate for the slowest trading day on record, only thirty-one shares\\nchanged hands. This was a far cry from the 338 million shares that changed\\nhands on an average day in 1995.\\nThe stock-trading business livened up a bit by 1835, when 121 companies\\nwere listed on the NYSE. The country was on the move with canals, turnpikes,\\nand bridges. These fantastic improvements required money, and the money came\\nfrom the sale of stocks and bonds. Bank stocks were no longer the hot items they\\nhad been a couple of decades before. The new hot item was railroad stocks and\\nbonds. At one point, people were buying anything with the name “rail” in it, and\\nnot caring what prices they paid. They were also paying higher and higher prices\\nfor any piece of land near a railroad. If they didn’t have the cash to buy the land,\\nthey could borrow it from the banks. Banks were lending huge sums on these\\nreal-estate deals, and large numbers of farmers were ignoring their crops and\\nbecoming real-estate tycoons.\\nThis was a home-grown bubble, similar to London’s South Sea bubble from\\nlong before, and in 1836 it burst. Stock prices and land prices came down as fast\\nas they had gone up, as investors tried to cash out. The would-be tycoons who\\nhad borrowed money to buy the stocks and the land were stuck with debts they\\ncouldn’t repay to the banks. The banks ran out of money, and people with\\nsavings accounts lost their savings when the banks closed their doors and went\\nout of business. Soon, cash was in such short supply that nobody could afford to\\nbuy anything. The financial system was on the verge of collapse. This was the\\nPanic of 1837.\\nThe American economy (and the economies of most countries) lurched from\\neuphoria to panic and back again. In the euphoric periods, when prices were\\nrising and jobs were plentiful, speculators would spend their last paycheck, hock\\ntheir jewelry, go into debt, do anything to buy stocks, or bonds, or land, and get\\nin on the action. Then, in the panics, collapses, and depressions, the speculators\\ngot their comeuppance and people sobered up.\\nThe stock market crashed in 1853 and again in 1857, when shares in the', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='popular Erie Railroad fell from sixty-two dollars to eleven dollars. Still only a\\ntiny percentage of the population owned stock—given the ups and downs in the\\nmarket, perhaps this was for the best. The brunt of the losses was borne once\\nagain by the Europeans, who, not having learned an earlier lesson, were pumping\\nmoney into U.S. investments. By the 1850s, nearly half of all U.S. shares were\\nowned by foreigners, mostly British.\\nAmerican Inventiveness\\nThe American people were regarded as an uncouth rabble by the more refined\\nEuropeans, and they saw us as poorly educated, roughshod Yankee doodles, but\\nwhat a surprise they got when all the great inventions began to pour out of\\nAmerican heads. American ingenuity was a response to our lack of manpower.\\nIn a huge country with a small population we needed to invent machines to do\\nsome of the work. Though clever inventors were dreaming up machines, this\\ndidn’t mean the machines would be brought to life. It was capitalism—people\\nwilling to invest their money to manufacture the machines—that led to the\\ngolden age of American invention.\\nThere was Fulton and his steamboat; George Cabot’s mill; Francis Cabot\\nLowell’s complete industrial factory; McCormick’s giant harvesting machine,\\nthe reaper, that spared the farmers from backbreaking work. While serving as a\\ntutor on a southern plantation, a Connecticut tinkerer named Eli Whitney\\ninvented the “gin” to remove seeds from cotton and single-handedly turned the\\nSouth into a mecca for cotton production. McCormick’s reaper, Samuel Colt’s\\nrepeating pistol, and a new kind of padlock were the three American inventions\\nthat wowed the crowds at a famous exhibition of industrial machinery at the\\nCrystal Palace in London in 1851. Europeans were amazed by American\\nproducts, and just as amazed by our system of manufacturing that standardized\\nthe quality so each item that rolled out of the shop was exactly the same as the\\nlast.\\nAgain, it took money to get these inventions off the drawing boards and into\\nproduction. Some of it was borrowed from banks, but more and more was raised\\nin the stock market, as shareholding grew in popularity at home and especially\\nabroad. Foreigners bankrolled our fantastic progress by investing in our\\nemerging market, and 150 years later, we are returning the favor by investing\\nhuge sums in the emerging markets of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.\\nOn the farm, machines improved the life of the farmer, who up until the', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='1850s was still using the same primitive methods that had been used five\\nthousand years earlier in Egypt. Farmers tilled the soil with plows pulled by\\nanimals, or with hand plows pulled by humans, and much of the stoop labor was\\ndone by slaves, who were victims of the system, the same as the slaves in ancient\\nMesopotamia.\\nAmong the causes of slavery, primitive agriculture was a major culprit.\\nSlavery was abolished when the bystanders came to their senses and raised\\nenough of a ruckus to put a stop to this evil practice, but capitalism deserves\\nsome of the credit. It took investors and their money to build the factories that\\nmade the farm equipment (threshers, reapers, disk harrows, steel plows, grain\\nelevators, and so forth) that changed agriculture forever. With new machines to\\ndo the backbreaking labor once reserved for slaves and serfs, there was no longer\\nan economic benefit in forcing people into a life of servitude.\\nSeveral of the companies that made farm equipment one hundred years ago\\nare still with us today: Deere, International Harvester (now called Navistar), and\\nCaterpillar. While they were inventing and selling the machines that could hoe,\\nplant, and harvest, other companies were inventing herbicides and fertilizers to\\nkill the bugs and the weeds and enrich the soil. The combination of new\\nequipment and new chemicals turned the American farm into the most efficient\\nfood bank on earth, capable of producing more wheat, corn, and so forth, per\\nacre than any other country’s farms in the history of agriculture.\\nTrue, ours was a fertile land, with hundreds of millions of acres of rich soil\\nlying beneath the fruited plains, unlike the tired, leeched-out, pawed-over soil\\nthe farmers of Europe and Asia had worked mercilessly for centuries until it lost\\nits fertility. Yet there’s no denying that innovations and inventions kept our\\nplains fruited, and made the American farm the envy of the world.\\nWhile a million Irish people lost their lives in potato famines, Chinese people\\nstarved because of rice shortages, and starvation was a fact of life for much of\\nhumanity, the United States produced and continues to produce more food than\\nits citizens could eat.\\nFarm machinery changed the way farmers raised crops, but it didn’t change\\nthe American diet, which was dreary and monotonous. Most families grew their\\nown food. The basic menu was bread, potatoes, root vegetables, and dried fruits,\\nlivened up with the occasional slice of salted or smoked meat. People ate\\nkidneys for breakfast. Kitchens lacked refrigerators, so fruits and vegetables\\ncould be eaten fresh only in the short stretches when the produce was “in\\nseason.”', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='In the winter, you got cucumber salad, pickled cucumber salad, or no salad at\\nall. If you didn’t live near the water, you couldn’t get fresh fish. Lemons were a\\nluxury, and an orange was something you found once a year in your Christmas\\nstocking, if you had a Christmas stocking. The tomato was an exotic Mexican\\nexport, widely distrusted because it was thought to be poisonous. Grapefruits\\nwere generally confined to Florida.\\nThere were no refrigerated trucks or railcars to move vegetables from one\\nplace to another, and the canning industry had not yet developed vegetables that\\ncould be kept on a shelf. People did their own canning at home, in glass jars,\\nwhenever they could get the extra produce. Cattle, sheep, and pigs were walking\\nrib steaks, lamb chops, and pork roasts, transported live from the farms to the\\ncities so their meat could be preserved “on the hoof.”\\nThese days, we hear a lot of nostalgia about the “good old days” when life\\nwas “simpler” and more “natural,” but the promoters of nostalgia might change\\ntheir tune if they ever experienced what simple living was really about: sweat\\nand backaches from dawn to dusk. Keeping a family fed, clothed, dry, and warm\\nwas a full-time job. Without our modern conveniences and products to help them\\nalong, women’s work was never done, and neither was men’s.\\nMost of the houses were handmade, and so were the clothes, the drapes, the\\nfurniture, and the soap. The average person might spend weeks without buying a\\nproduct made by a company, public or private. It took hours to make the food,\\nand hours to tend the gardens, and more hours to cut the firewood for the stoves.\\nThe smoke from stoves and fireplaces was a major pollutant, both in and around\\nthe houses where people spent most of their time. So much for the fresh air that\\neverybody supposedly enjoyed in those days.\\nThere was no TV, which might have been a blessing, because a lot of people\\nhad no time for TV. Today, we talk about “home entertainment,” but in the old\\ndays, it really did come from inside the home: card games, puzzles, music\\nmaking, storytelling, and jokes.\\nIf this sort of entertainment was so wonderful, then why did so many people\\nturn to the radio and later to the television?\\nRailroads and Commerce\\nThe stock market continued to gain in popularity throughout the nineteenth\\ncentury, thanks in part to Thomas Edison’s first commercially successful\\ninvention, the tickertape machine. This was a printing device covered by a glass', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='bowl that made it look like a bubblegum dispenser. Every time a stock was\\nbought or sold, a record of the trade was sent via telegraph to tickertapes around\\nthe country and the world.\\nIt came out on the tape, an endless roll of paper that showed the stock symbol,\\nthe price, the number of shares that changed hands. Anybody with access to a\\nticker could watch the tape and keep tabs on stock prices, up to the minute.\\nBefore Edison invented this machine there was no way of telling what stocks\\nwere doing, unless you were standing on the floor of a stock exchange. But as\\nsoon as tickertapes were installed, investors could follow their favorite stocks\\nright along with the insiders on Wall Street.\\nThe American economy grew eightfold between the 1790s and the Civil War.\\nThis meant that the population was making eight times as many products, and\\nbuying and selling them at eight times the rate of the colonial inhabitants. We\\nwere well on our way to becoming the world’s greatest industrial power. With\\nthe Civil War behind us and slavery abolished (although racial discrimination\\nclearly was not abolished), the population expanded westward, and the skylines\\nof the cities expanded upward, as everywhere in the country people were on the\\nmove.\\nBy 1855, textile mills were popping up along the rivers in New England, and\\nno fewer than forty-six cotton textile companies sold shares on the Boston stock\\nexchange. When soldiers returned from the Civil War, where they’d gotten\\naccustomed to wearing uniforms, they went out and bought a new kind of\\nuniform, the ready-made suit. Soap and candles, leather and maple sugar, all\\ntraditional homemade products, could now be bought in stores. Trade barriers\\nbetween one state and another were broken down so mass-produced goods could\\ncross state lines.\\nTwo railroad companies, the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific, were\\nchosen to extend the lines across the country to the Pacific. Occasionally, a fight\\nwould break out among the Irish, German, or Chinese workers along the line, but\\ntogether they put their muscle into laying the track and hammering the spikes.\\nCongress granted 170 million acres to various railroads in different parts of\\nthe country—this was the biggest gift of property in U.S. history, and a very\\ncontroversial one. The railroads sold some of this land to farmers and used some\\nof it as collateral for the huge loans they took out to pay the workers and buy the\\ntrack, railroad cars, and other expensive equipment.\\nSeveral of today’s railroad companies still own vast tracts of valuable acreage\\nfrom the original government land grants. It’s an incredible asset for them.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='The railroads carried the freight, plus the passengers, and they brought\\ncrowds of new buyers into the stock market. In this second railroad boom,\\ninvestors put $318 million of their own money into railroad stocks, and out came\\nthirteen thousand miles of track.

Without this money and these breaks, who knows when the\\nterritory would have opened up?\\nRailroad stocks, how could they miss! was the rallying cry of investors from\\ncoast to coast. People saw the rail lines fanning out to the far corners of the\\nnation, and the locomotives puffing along, and they were convinced that\\nrailroads were a can’t-lose proposition.\\nA sizeable number of farmers were speculating in railroad stocks, in railroad\\nland, and in the land companies created by the Homestead Act of 1862. Some of\\nthese railroad projects and land projects turned out to be fly-by-night schemes, as\\ndid many of the gold and silver mining ventures that came along behind the\\nrailroads.\\nMark Twain is said to have once described a gold mine as a “hole in the\\nground owned by a liar,” and more often than not, that liar was selling shares.\\nFar more money was made by the people who sold shares in unproven mines\\nthan was made by all the prospectors who brought their pans and their picks to\\nCalifornia.

They put the money in banks, where the situation had become somewhat\\nless chaotic than it had been when banking was run by the states. The endless\\nvarieties of currency that made shopping so confusing disappeared in the mid-\\n1860s when a new federal banking system was established. From then on, we\\nhad one national currency, the U.S. dollar.\\nAmericans stashed so much cash in the banks that from the Civil War to\\nWorld War I they saved an amazing 18 percent of the country’s total industrial\\noutput. Because the cash was used to build better factories and better roads to\\ntransport the goods from the factories, workers became more efficient. They\\ncould produce more goods for the same amount of work.\\nThe supply of money increased forty times over, but there was hardly any\\ninflation. These days, when a would-be emerging nation such as Russia prints\\nmore money, we see an immediate collapse in the value of the money, and prices\\ngo through the roof. But in the second half of the nineteenth century, when the\\nUnited States was an emerging nation, prices held steady, even though the banks', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='had begun printing money like crazy. The reason this printing of money didn’t\\ncause inflation was that our industrial output was growing right along with the\\nmoney supply.\\nAnother factor that may have contributed to the national prosperity is that our\\nborders were effectively closed to many foreign-made goods by prohibitive\\ntariffs. These days, we hear a lot about free trade and what a good thing it is, but\\nduring the heyday of the U.S. economy, when we had our fastest growth and our\\nfactories were running at full speed, foreign competitors had trouble entering our\\nmarkets and our industries were somewhat protected from overseas competition.\\nThe inventions kept coming out of the American mind: the telegraph, the\\ntelephone, the automobile, the vulcanized rubber tire. People were inventing\\nbetter mousetraps, better everythings, a machine for every job that once had been\\ndone by human hands. In the 1880s, a bill was introduced in Congress to close\\nthe U.S. Patent Office, on the theory that every important invention had already\\nbeen invented. How wrong that turned out to be!\\nThere was a machine to roll cigarettes, made by a company called Bonsack\\nand first used by a Carolina tobacco farmer named James Duke—the Duke of\\nDuke University. There was a machine to make matches, a machine to make\\nflour (Pillsbury got hold of that one), a machine to condense milk (the Borden\\nmilk company had the exclusive rights), a new method for making steel (the\\nBessemer process), and a machine for canning soup (first used at Campbell’s).\\nThere was a machine to produce the floating Ivory soap that was created by\\nmistake in a lab at Procter & Gamble.\\nOnce new machines were invented, somebody had to invent more machines\\nto make the new machines, plus parts and tools to repair them. Instead of\\nmachines putting people out of work, as many critics of the machine age had\\npredicted, they actually created work. For every job lost to a hunk of metal, a\\ncouple of jobs were opened up. And with each advance in the sophistication of\\nmachines, the work got easier. Factory-made goods were cheaper to produce\\nthan handmade goods, and in many cases they were superior to handmade goods,\\nor at least the quality was more consistent. Cheaper goods could be sold more\\ncheaply to the customers, who got more and more for their money whenever an\\nindustry was mechanized.\\nThe Growth of National Brands\\nWhen the twentieth century rolled around, there was a thriving snack-food', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='industry, with all sorts of jellies, jams, biscuits, candies, and chewing gum being\\nproduced and distributed nationwide by companies that sold stock on the stock\\nexchange. You could eat these things and invest in these things.\\nWe’d come a long way from the dreary days when the only choices in snack\\nfoods were pilot bread, cold-water crackers, butter crackers, square soda\\ncrackers, and round sugar biscuits. These had been made by neighborhood\\nbakeries and sold out of cracker barrels at the local general store.\\nThe most famous cracker in the country was the Uneeda, a brand name as\\npopular as Coca-Cola is today, made by the National Biscuit Company,\\notherwise known as Nabisco. Nabisco was the end result of decades of mergers\\nin which many small family bakeries were consolidated into two regional\\nbakeries: the American Biscuit Company in the Midwest and the New York\\nBiscuit Company in the East. These two megabakeries joined forces to become\\nNabisco, which went public around the turn of the century by selling $30 million\\nworth of stock. There were thirteen hundred original shareholders, including\\nseveral celebrities, but anybody could have bought a share.\\nUnder the clever leadership of Adolphus Green, Nabisco put an end to the\\ncracker barrel as an American institution and put some fun into snack foods. It\\nbegan to package the cookies and crackers to keep them crisp and dry and to\\nprotect them from being contaminated by dirty hands in the cracker barrel. While\\ncontinuing to make the bland Uneeda biscuit, Nabisco produced a string of new\\nproducts: Fig Newtons (named for Newton, Massachusetts), Premium Saltines,\\nBarnum’s Animal Crackers (1902), Lorna Doones and Oreo cookies (1912), and\\nRitz Crackers (1934).\\nThe Oreo became the world’s best-selling cookie, and it still is today. The\\nOreo has been around so long, we forget that it was produced in a Nabisco lab.\\nNabisco also acquired the rights to the first interesting snack for dogs, the Milk\\nBone.\\nThere was Planter’s peanuts, invented by a pushcart vendor named Amadeo\\nObici, who worked the streets of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, at the turn of the\\ncentury. Obici decided one day to sprinkle his peanuts with salt. His salted\\npeanuts were such a big hit that in 1906 Obici joined with a partner to form the\\nPlanter’s Nut & Chocolate Company, later to become the Planter’s Life Savers\\nCompany, which grew up to become a world-famous brand name, and a division\\nof RJR Nabisco.\\nThere was Heinz ketchup, concocted by a Pennsylvania pickle maker, Henry\\nJ. Heinz. Heinz, who was wiped out and went bankrupt in the Panic of 1873,', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='went on to become the world’s pickle king, sauce king, and popularizer of\\nketchup.

A minister and\\nlecturer for the Temperance Union, Graham spoke out against liquor, meat,\\nmustard, and even Heinz’s ketchup (which he said caused insanity) and in favor\\nof cold showers, hard mattresses, fruits, raw vegetables, and whole wheat flour,\\nwhich went into his new snack food. The way he saw it, the Graham cracker was\\nno ordinary cracker. It was a cure for lust and a tamer of teenage hormones,\\nwhich Graham thought were riled up by a diet of meats and fats. According to\\nhis theory, the teenager who ate Graham crackers was calmer and better behaved\\nand could more easily concentrate on homework.\\nWhile Graham was on his cracker crusade, Dr. John Kellogg was also\\nfighting teenage lust (he called it “dangerous desires”) with cornflakes. A\\nvegetarian and a health faddist who ran a famous sanitarium in Battle Creek,\\nMichigan, Dr. Kellogg was experimenting with a bread recipe one day, trying to\\nmake a new kind of toast that was easier to chew than the popular “zwieback”\\nthat was so hard people chipped their teeth on it. He left the oven on too long\\nand his experimental bread was reduced to flakes. Soon, Kellogg was convinced\\nthat a regular diet of these flakes could douse the flames of the hottest romance\\nand keep the youth of America out of trouble.\\nNot too many people agreed with Kellogg, or for that matter, with Sylvester\\nGraham, but that didn’t stop the entire nation from falling in love with Graham’s\\ncrackers and Kellogg’s cereal.\\nKellogg made the acquaintance of C. W. Post, a fast-talking promoter who', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='was a patient at Kellogg’s sanitarium. Post went there looking for a cure for his\\nnervous exhaustion and ate his first bowl of Kellogg’s flakes. He liked the\\ncereal, but he hated the caramel coffee that Kellogg served at breakfast. So that\\nhe’d have something better to drink, Post invented Postum, a grain-based grog\\nthat tasted like coffee—at least Post thought so. Post set up a company to sell\\nPostum on a grand scale, along with a couple of cereals he developed—Grape\\nNuts and Post Toasties.\\nThere was Hershey and his candy bar—Milton Snaveley Hershey, to be exact,\\nthe owner of a tiny caramel store who went to the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair\\nand saw the demonstration of a German chocolate-making machine and ordered\\none for himself. Hershey used the machine to churn out chocolate-covered\\ncaramels, followed by the first mass-produced chocolate bar, followed by\\nHershey’s Kisses in 1907 and the Hershey’s Goodbar with peanuts in 1925.\\nHershey stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1927.\\nThere was Jerome Smucker, who sold apple butter and apple cider made from\\ntrees planted by Johnny Appleseed in Ohio. In 1897, Smucker founded the J. M.\\nSmucker Company, which a century later sells more jellies and jams than\\nanybody else in the country.\\nAt this point, a thousand trademarks were registered in the United States, and\\nslogans and jingles had entered the American vocabulary, such as “absolutely\\npure,” which came from the Royal Baking Company; “you press the button, we\\ndo the rest,” from Kodak; “it floats,” from Ivory soap; “the beer that made\\nMilwaukee famous,” from Schlitz; “all the news that’s fit to print,” from The\\nNew York Times; and “pink pills for pale people,” from the ads for a vitamin\\nconcoction sold by a medicine man known as Dr. Williams.\\nThe invention of all these products led to the creation of new stores where\\nthey could be sold. As late as the mid-1800s, the country had no supermarkets.\\nNobody had thought of a mass-market grocery until a couple of tea lovers,\\nGeorge Gilman and George Huntington Hartford, opened a tea shop in New\\nYork, near the site of today’s World Trade Center, in 1859. It was a small\\nbusiness with a big-sounding name: the Great American Tea Company. Later,\\nthe name was changed so it sounded even bigger: the Great Atlantic and Pacific\\nTea Company.\\nOne tea shop in New York led to five tea shops in New York, then tea shops\\nout of state, and by that time Gilman and Hartford had put coffee, butter, and\\nmilk on the shelves. In 1912, they had a chain of four hundred stores, the first\\nmass-market grocery, and by the late 1920s, they had fifteen thousand stores', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='nationwide with $1 billion in annual sales. It would have been hard to find a\\nserious shopper anywhere in the country who hadn’t heard of the A&P.\\nThanks to a growing number of chain stores and mail-order catalogues,\\npeople could buy mass-produced goods of reliable quality and at much lower\\nprices than the prices charged by itinerant peddlers or local independent\\nmerchants. In small towns and on farms, the arrival of a package in the mail was\\nan important event, especially if it came from Montgomery Ward (named for its\\nfounder, Aaron Montgomery Ward, who formed the first mail-order company in\\nChicago in 1872), or from Sears Roebuck and Company, which sent out its first\\ncatalogue in 1887.\\nAt first, Sears only sold watches, but it quickly expanded into general\\nmerchandise. The story goes that a prospector in Nome, Alaska, sent Sears a\\nprepaid order for one hundred rolls of toilet paper and enclosed cash in the\\nenvelope. Sears wrote back that it couldn’t accept any order that didn’t come\\nfrom the catalogue. The customer replied, “If I had the catalogue, I wouldn’t\\nneed the toilet paper.”\\nAs more merchandise was sent long-distance, the railroads had more freight\\nto deliver, and the mail played a bigger role in people’s lives. The mail was\\ncrucial to capitalism, because it was the most effective way to get mass-produced\\ngoods into the hands of the masses. Even then, the post office had a reputation\\nfor lousy service, and the producers of goods were upset about it. Speedy\\ndelivery was so important to business that Adolphus Green took time out from\\nrunning Nabisco to spearhead a campaign to reform the post office.\\nThe Industrial Era and the Robber Barons\\nCorporations had built the factories, the girders, the underpinnings of modern\\nAmerica. By the mid-nineteenth century, less than a quarter of the country’s\\nbusiness was done by corporations, but moving toward the twentieth, companies\\nwere having an impact on every aspect of domestic life.\\nMass production was the watchword of the day: The goods could roll from\\nthe factories into the railroad cars to be distributed across state lines, making\\nregional markets out of what used to be neighborhood markets of small shops,\\nwith little variety in the merchandise. This expansion of markets was a\\nrevolutionary change in society, which affected people’s daily lives as much as\\nor more than the American Revolution itself. Whereas before 1820, two-thirds of\\nthe clothing worn in the United States was made at home by hand, by the end of', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='the century most of it came from factories.\\nCompany names and brand names such as Diamond, Pillsbury, Campbell,\\nHeinz, Borden, Quaker Oats, Libby, and Procter & Gamble became household\\nwords. Household products became celebrities, just as famous as well-known\\nwriters, painters, entertainers, or politicians. By the 1880s, Ivory soap was\\nrecognized from coast to coast. In 1884, George Eastman came up with a way to\\nmass-produce the film to make photographs, and ten years later, taking pictures\\nwith Kodak film and Kodak cameras had become a national pastime.\\nThe machine age and mass production came along so fast that people hardly\\nhad time to prepare for it. Property laws had to be rewritten, new rules of\\ncommerce established, new business arrangements entered into. A small group\\nof people took advantage of the situation and enriched themselves beyond the\\nwildest dreams of their contemporaries. These men amassed fortunes that\\ndwarfed the fortunes of the richest pharaohs, sultans, potentates, kings, queens,\\nconquistadores, and empire builders in all of history. They were known as the\\nrobber barons, a term coined by historian Matthew Josephson in the late 1920s.\\nThe robber barons were not robbers in the traditional sense, nor were they\\nlawbreakers, although some of them bent the laws, and even had the laws\\nrewritten, for their own benefit. They were high-rolling speculators, most of\\nthem raised in poverty, who struggled, connived, and strong-armed their way to\\nthe top of American industry. They stretched the envelope of money.\\nAmong them were Jay Gould, the son of a poor farmer in upstate New York,\\nwho by hook and by crook built a fabulous railroad empire; Andrew Carnegie,\\nthe son of Scottish weavers, who also owned railroads and became the nation’s\\nmost powerful iron magnate; Cornelius Vanderbilt, a roughneck on the docks of\\nNew York, who built a fleet of steamships, controlled the shipping industry and\\nafter that railroads, but in spite of his success and his wealth, lived for many\\nyears in a small house with a ratty old carpet; Daniel Drew, a cattle drover who\\nwas a master at manipulating the stock market for his own benefit; J. P. Morgan,\\nthe devoted churchgoer whose bank became so powerful he was once asked to\\nbail out the U.S. government; Jay Cooke, the eternally optimistic stock and bond\\ndealer whose investment company was so big and powerful that when it\\ncollapsed, the country almost collapsed with it; “Diamond” Jim Fisk, a former\\npushcart peddler and circus fancier who wore loud clothes and rings on every fat\\nfinger; Russell Sage, a crafty stock speculator and railroad tycoon; Leland\\nStanford, who became governor of California and used his political clout to build\\nthe railroads there, enriching himself and later Stanford University, which took', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='his name and his money.\\nLast but not least was John D. Rockefeller, son of a snake-oil salesman, and\\nhimself a devout Baptist, a combination that produced a shrewd and fearsome\\ncapitalist, who gathered all the oil companies into a giant monopoly that could\\nraise prices at will and force all its rivals into submission. More on this later.\\nWith one or two exceptions, the robber barons were conservative in their\\npersonal lives, often devoutly religious, and oddly frugal given the size of their\\nbankrolls. Most of them built or owned railroads, and they were plotting\\nconstantly to take over each other’s rail lines. They knew how to control the\\nstock market to make the prices of railroad stocks zig and zag, and they made\\nmillions on the zigs.\\nDiamond Jim Fisk wasn’t called “first in the pockets of his countrymen” for\\nno reason, and Jay Gould was a champion at talking up his Erie Railroad stock,\\nso people would pay much more than these shares were worth. It was because of\\nGould that the Erie was called the “Scarlet Woman of Wall Street”—a company\\nwith a ruined credit rating that paid no dividend to shareholders between 1873\\nand 1942.\\nWhen Jay Cooke closed the doors of his banking offices because his railroad\\ninvestments had soured, he triggered the Panic of 1873, which brought down\\nseveral brokerage houses and almost put Wall Street out of business.\\nWhile the population doubled from 1864 to the early 1900s, the rail network\\nincreased sevenfold, and every American was within earshot of a railroad\\nwhistle. A twenty-two-year-old veteran of the Union forces, George\\nWestinghouse, invented the air brake; electric lights replaced the gas and\\nkerosene lamps; and Pullman came along with his manufactured railroad cars.\\nEven though the railroads were everywhere, people lost money on the stocks.\\nThere was always a crisis or a scandal that wiped out the small investors, while\\nthe robber barons managed to rake in the profits. In 1877, one of the most\\nsuccessful among them, Cornelius Vanderbilt, died in New York, leaving his\\nentire fortune, a whopping $100 million, to his son William Vanderbilt.\\nThe elder Vanderbilt was considered the richest man in American when he\\ndied, and he made his pile on shipping and then on railroads, particularly the\\nNew York Central. As often as he was praised as a titan of commerce, he was\\ncursed as an aristocratic ingrate who gave nothing back to the people whose\\nsweat had built the railroads and created his fortune.\\nThe public was outraged that he departed from life having left nothing to the\\ncommunity. Vanderbilt himself believed he had done enough good by creating', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='the railroad, and his money was his own business. His son William was more\\nblunt about it. “The public be damned,” he once said.\\nIn the emerging market of the United States, things didn’t happen in an\\norderly fashion. The same is true in many contemporary emerging markets.\\nEvery couple of decades, the economy broke down, and people would panic and\\nrush to the banks to rescue their money, most of which had already been loaned\\nout. The banks couldn’t possibly pay back all their depositors at once, so they\\ncollapsed. Once the banks collapsed and entire communities were left without\\nmoney, all sorts of businesses would fail, and the financial system would go into\\nthe tank. The stock market would crash, and so would the bond market, because\\nthe organizations that issued the bonds couldn’t make the interest payments.\\nThe Europeans were big losers in the Panic of 1873, just as they had been in\\nearlier such calamities. Because of our frequent crashes and panics, the United\\nStates got the reputation of being a nation of sharpies who couldn’t be trusted in\\na business deal, the same sort of thing that’s recently been said about some of the\\nChinese and Russian entrepreneurs. We were the deadbeats of yesteryear.\\nIn the Panic of 1893 (the big ones seemed to come at twenty-year intervals)\\none-fourth of the railroad companies were forced into bankruptcy. There was a\\nlesser panic in 1903. Panic or no panic, some great companies that got their start\\nin this period are still great companies today, employing hundreds of thousands\\nof workers and making money for the shareholders. Half the countries that\\nappeared on the world maps of 1900 have disappeared, but Hershey’s, Quaker\\nOats, Wrigley’s, AT&T, Du Pont, the Bank of Boston, American Tobacco, U.S.\\nSteel, and the various spinoffs of Standard Oil (Exxon, Chevron, Mobil, Amoco,\\nand so forth) are going strong.\\nThe Dreaded Monopolies\\nWhen the twentieth century rolled around, it was obvious that something was\\nwrong with the way capitalism was going. It had started out as a free-for-all\\nwhen anybody with a good idea had a chance to succeed. It was turning into a\\nrigged game dominated by a few giant businesses. These were called\\nmonopolies.\\nYou could make the case that monopolies are as big a threat to our way of life\\nas any America ever faced, short of Adolf Hitler and communism. If you’ve\\nplayed the game Monopoly, you understand the concept. The goal is to buy up\\nall the properties so that people who land on them have no choice but to pay', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='outrageous rents. A player who can do this ends up with all the money.\\nIn the real world, a monopoly is exactly the same, but it doesn’t just happen\\nwith real estate. It happens when there’s one bigshot in an industry that controls\\neverything and sets the prices. In a bakery monopoly, for instance, there’s only\\none company making and selling cakes and cookies, so customers have to pay\\nwhatever the company wants to charge, or give up cakes and cookies. Whether\\nit’s bakeries, toy makers, or airlines, when a monopoly is formed, the customers\\nhave no choice. There’s no other baker, toy maker, or airline they can go to,\\nbecause all the competitors have either joined the monopoly or been driven out\\nof business.\\nThe trading companies you’ve already read about—the Virginia Company,\\nthe United Dutch East India Company, and so forth—were all monopolies. Their\\ncharters, granted by the kings of Europe, gave them the exclusive right to do\\nbusiness in huge expanses of territory in the New World. For a thousand miles\\nalong the coastline of America, these companies controlled farming, fishing, and\\ntrading with the Indians. Nobody could compete with them—without their\\npermission.\\nThe first person to understand that monopolies posed a threat to the future\\nprosperity of the world was Adam Smith, the author of The Wealth of Nations.\\nSmith realized that competition was the key to capitalism. As long as somebody\\nelse could come along and make a product better and cheaper, a company\\ncouldn’t do a lousy job and expect to get away with it. Competition kept\\ncompanies on their toes. They were forced to improve their products and keep\\ntheir prices as low as possible, or they’d lose their customers to a rival.\\nBy the middle of the nineteenth century, when the U.S. economy was\\nbooming along, there were many companies in every industry and the\\ncompetition was fierce. The owners of the companies didn’t necessarily like this\\nsituation, even if it was a good thing for society, as Adam Smith said. In fact,\\nthey thought competition was a menace. They were tired of having to fend off\\ncompetitors by improving their products. They were looking for a chance to\\ncharge higher prices for things, prices customers would be forced to pay no\\nmatter what.\\nIf they’d been allowed to, all the owners in a given industry, say bakeries,\\ncould have gotten together in a room somewhere and decided to charge the same\\nhigh prices for their cookies and their cakes. They could have made deals to\\navoid competing with one another. They could have formed strategic alliances.\\nIn fact, price-fixing cartels were established in the United States in the 1870s and', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='1880s, but laws were passed to make cartels—or “pools,” as they were called—\\nillegal.\\nIn the early 1880s, a clever lawyer named S. C. T. Dodd figured out how\\ncompanies could get around the laws against cartels by forming trusts. A trust\\nwas an ancient method of putting a group of properties under the control of one\\nmanager. While working in the legal department at John D. Rockefeller’s oil\\ncompany, Dodd brought his idea to Rockefeller’s attention. Why not put a bunch\\nof oil companies together in a trust? That way, the owners could fix prices, make\\ndeals, and avoid having to compete—and it would all be completely legal.\\nRockefeller immediately set out to organize a Dodd-style trust among his\\nforty biggest competitors in the oil business. He invited them to participate,\\nalthough they didn’t have much choice. Any companies that refused the\\ninvitation, Rockefeller threatened to put out of business, by selling oil at such\\nlow prices they couldn’t afford to compete with him.\\nHis tactics were far from friendly, but they were effective. He and his forty\\ncohorts, some of them reluctant, formed the Standard Oil Trust. Overnight, it\\nbecame the largest and most powerful oil producer in the world, controlling most\\nof the U.S. oil wells and 90 percent of the refineries. Rockefeller and his closest\\nadvisors were now dictators of oil, raising prices at will. Customers had no\\nchoice but to pay Rockefeller’s high rates—otherwise, they’d get no oil.\\nThe dictators also used their newfound muscle on the railroad companies,\\nforcing them to lower their prices for transporting the oil. They didn’t have much\\nchoice, either. Any railroad that refused to ship for less, Rockefeller could drive\\nout of business. After all, if they didn’t ship his oil, they didn’t ship any oil,\\nbecause more than 90 percent of the national output was refined by the trust.\\nStandard Oil extended its monopoly over every aspect of the business. From\\nthe wells to the refineries, Rockefeller was in charge. And once they’d heard of\\nhis success, the owners of other kinds of companies began to form trusts. There\\nwas a sugar trust, a whiskey trust, a cotton oil trust, a lead trust, and a tobacco\\ntrust created by James Duke and his rival tobacco farmers, who joined forces to\\nbecome the American Tobacco Company.\\nThere was a ham trust (Swift Brothers), a fruit trust (United Fruit), and a\\ncookie-and-biscuit trust, (Nabisco). Companies that didn’t form trusts could link\\nthemselves in a different way, by merging. Several companies could merge into\\nwhat was called a conglomerate. Mergers produced International Harvester, Du\\nPont, Anaconda Copper, Diamond Match, and American Smelting and Refining\\nnow called ASARCO. The railroads got into the act, with several of the bigger', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='ones involved in mergers and takeovers. Dozens of railroad lines were\\nconsolidated into a few big groups: the Vanderbilt roads, Pennsylvania roads,\\nHill roads, Harriman lines, Gould roads, and the Rock Island system. When\\nrailroads got into financial trouble, as they so often did, banker J. P. Morgan was\\nthere to reorganize them.\\nMorgan, a formidable presence on Wall Street in his vested suits and his top\\nhat, took eight small steel companies and merged them in 1901 to form the giant\\nU.S. Steel, the most powerful conglomeration to date and America’s first billion-\\ndollar enterprise.\\nOne-third of all public companies in the United States disappeared into trusts\\nand mergers between 1895 and 1904. In most major industries, trusts and\\nconglomerates were raising prices at will. They were throwing their weight\\naround in all areas of commerce.\\nThe American people saw what was happening, competitors disappearing in\\none industry after another, the owners of trusts raking in the millions and\\nbuilding summer “cottages” as big as army barracks along the coast at Newport,\\nRhode Island. So the public turned against the trusts.\\nPeople realized that the giant companies would tighten their hold on the\\nsmaller companies, forcing them to join trusts or be driven out of business, and if\\nthis trend were allowed to continue, prices for everything would jump through\\nthe roof, and the wallets of the nation would be sucked dry. With a few insiders\\ncontrolling both prices and wages, free-market capitalism would cease to exist.\\nThis was one of the scariest periods in American history, and it is rarely\\ndiscussed. Here we were, a 125-year-old country going into a new decade after a\\ntremendous spurt of growth and prosperity, and we were losing the economic\\nfreedom we had worked so hard to gain, losing it to a bunch of trusts.\\nThere were scandals everywhere: writer Upton Sinclair exposed meat-packing\\nhouses that sold tainted meat—this sort of journalism was known as\\n“muckraking.” People joined unions to fight for better pay and reverse the drop\\nin wages imposed by the trusts. Where trusts controlled the jobs, individual\\nworkers had no leverage. They couldn’t very well quit and find jobs elsewhere—\\nthere was no elsewhere.\\nThe unions, the newspapers, the courts, and some courageous politicial\\nleaders all had a hand in foiling the trusts and rescuing the country from the\\ngreedy few. It if hadn’t been for these trust busters, we could have gotten\\nourselves into a situation in which the average person in America was no better\\noff than a Russian peasant. Then we might have had a revolution like Russia’s,', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='and what a tragedy that would have been.\\nFortunately for everyone except the owners of the trusts, the courts and the\\ngovernment fought hard against the trusts. In 1890, Congress passed the\\nSherman Antitrust Act, but several big offenders wiggled out of it by turning\\nthemselves into “holding companies” and moving to New Jersey. New Jersey\\nhad passed its own law making it easy for would-be trusts to organize as holding\\ncompanies and avoid the federal regulations. The giant U.S. Steel was a holding\\ncompany.\\nIn 1904, the U.S. Supreme Court struck another blow—it outlawed one of the\\nbiggest railroad trusts. Teddy Roosevelt was president at the time. He revived\\nthe Sherman Act by bringing suit against forty-four major trusts. A camper,\\nhunter, and all-around outdoorsman, Roosevelt was nicknamed “Rough Rider”\\nafter his famous charge up Cuba’s San Juan Hill in the Spanish-American War.\\nBut far more important than winning that war was winning the war against the\\ntrusts. He became the nation’s “Trust Buster.” In 1914, Congress passed a\\nsecond antitrust act, the Clayton Act.\\nBeginning with Standard Oil in 1911, many of the nation’s biggest trusts were\\nbroken up, and competition in the major industries was restored. The\\ngovernment has been on the lookout ever since for companies that get too big\\nand too powerful and threaten to monopolize an industry. Whenever that\\nhappens, the government can file an antitrust suit, and if it wins, the courts can\\nforce the company to divide itself into smaller companies that are independent\\nfrom one another. That way, competition is restored.\\nAt one point, Alcoa controlled the U.S. aluminum industry, until it was forced\\nto break itself up. The same thing happened to AT&T, which was the only phone\\ncompany of any consequence until Judge Harold Green, in a famous decision,\\nforced AT&T to divide itself into eight parts, with Ma Bell, the parent company,\\nkeeping the long-distance business, and the seven Baby Bells getting the local\\nbusiness. Since that crucial ruling, dozens of other companies have come along\\nto compete with Ma Bell and the Baby Bells, which is why phone calls are\\ngetting cheaper and cheaper every day. This is great for long-distance romance\\nand keeps many couples in constant communication, so they won’t have a\\nbreakup the way AT&T did.\\nThe AT&T case is a good example of what’s wrong with monopolies and\\nwhy competition is in everyone’s best interest. Before the AT&T breakup, the\\ncompany employed 1 million people—one out of every one hundred American\\nworkers had a job with Ma Bell. Today, Ma Bell and the seven Baby Bells', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='together employ only six hundred thousand workers, while the volume of phone\\ncalls has more than tripled.\\nCompetition has forced the phone companies to cut costs and become more\\nefficient. They still have to comply with certain regulations, such as offering\\nphone service to everyone in the region—otherwise, people who live in the\\nboonies where it’s expensive to string a phone line would never get a phone. But\\nwe can thank competition for the fact that more calls can be made with fewer\\nworkers, and we pay lower rates on our phone bills as a result.\\nMicrosoft, as you probably know, is the world’s largest software company.\\nRecently, it announced a plan to take over another large software company,\\nIntuit. The government objected to this plan, on the theory that a Microsoft-Intuit\\ncombination would create a software monopoly. After learning of the\\ngovernment’s disapproval, Microsoft decided not to pursue Intuit. Nobody likes\\nto fight the trust busters in Washington.\\nThe one monopoly that has been allowed to survive with the government’s\\nblessing is major league baseball. Because it’s the national pastime, Congress\\ngave it an exemption from the antitrust laws. The players have complained\\nbitterly about this, and after the recent baseball strike, Congress threatened to\\ntake away baseball’s exemption. It hasn’t happened yet, but someday it might.\\nDow’s Famous Average\\nIn 1884, a journalist named Charles Henry Dow invented a way for fans of\\nstocks to follow the overall stock market. He put together a list of eleven\\nimportant stocks, and at the end of each trading session, he took the closing price\\nfor each one, added them up, and divided by eleven. This gave him an average,\\nwhich he published in a news bulletin called the Customer’s Afternoon Letter.\\nAt first, Dow’s average was nothing more than a curiosity, but eventually it\\ngave him a place in history. It became known as the Dow Jones average (Jones\\nbeing Dow’s partner in the news business), which has been the financial\\nyardstick for stocks for more than a century. Even today, 110 years later, when\\npeople ask “What is the market doing?” or “where did the market close?” they\\nare talking about the Dow Jones average. When somebody says: “It’s up thirty\\npoints,” or “down fifty points,” they are using Dow’s number.\\nThe original Dow Jones average included nine railroads, because the railroads\\nwere held in such high esteem on Wall Street, and people believed that the\\nrailroads would dominate American business forever. Twelve years later, Dow', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='put together another average, the industrials, for the gritty businesses (oil and gas\\nrefiners, coal producers, smelters, and so forth) that turned raw materials into the\\nfuel, steel, and rubber on which the entire economy depended. The earliest Dow\\nindustrials were dominant companies in their own right, big, powerful\\nenterprises that were the Microsofts and the Wal-Marts of their day, but most of\\nthem have disappeared without a trace.\\nWho’s ever heard of American Cotton Oil, Chicago Gas, Laclede Gas,\\nNational Lead, Tennessee Coal & Iron, or U.S. Rubber? All these companies\\nmade the Dow’s original list of industrials. The only name you’d recognize is\\nGeneral Electric, which has kept its place on the list over the years.\\nThis is an important lesson for investors. Business is like sports, in that the\\nwinning teams and successful organizations don’t necessarily stay on top\\nforever. As hard as it is to reach the top in business or in sports, it’s even harder\\nto stay there. The New York Yankees found that out after their dynasty came to\\nan end in the 1970s. So did the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Boston Celtics. So did\\nTennessee Coal & Iron, Laclede Gas, and American Cotton Oil. General Electric\\nis a rare example of a winner that manages to keep winning.\\nYou can see how much America has changed by comparing the earliest Dow\\nindustrials to today’s expanded list of thirty. McDonald’s is on today’s list—how\\nindustrial is a hamburger? Not very, unless you figure it takes a cast-iron\\nstomach to digest one, but McDonald’s is such an important company that it’s\\nbeen included. When Dow chose his original industrials, no restaurant company\\nwas big enough to have even crossed his mind. Coca-Cola is included in today’s\\nDow. A company as far-reaching and as powerful as Coke belongs on the list.\\nIt’s come a long way from the 1920s, when it was so small that most investors\\nwouldn’t have noticed it. Disney is in the Dow, but it didn’t get started as a\\npublic company until 1940. When Clarence Dow invented the Dow, Walt Disney\\nhadn’t drawn the first Mickey Mouse.\\nThe modern Dow is proof that America is no longer the gritty industrial giant\\nthat lives off the output from coal mines, ironworks, and steel mills. As factories\\nand mills have faded into the background on Main Street and on Wall Street, the\\nrestaurants, banks, mass merchandisers, entertainment companies, and lately, the\\ncomputer and software companies, have taken their place at the forefront.\\nCompany Towns\\nThe number of Americans who worked on farms was dropping fast. After 1920,', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='most people lived in cities, because that’s where companies did most of their\\nbusiness, and that’s where the jobs were. Some companies even built their own\\ntowns so the workers would have a nice place to live. U.S. Steel created Gary,\\nIndiana, and the Hershey Chocolate Company designed Hershey, Pennsylvania,\\nfrom the ground up—not with gingerbread and gumdrop houses and lollipops for\\nstreetlights, the way Willy Wonka would have done it, but people liked it\\nanyway. Hershey is still a nice place to live today, but several other company\\ntowns came to a bad end. One of the best examples was Pullman, Illinois,\\nlocated on the rim of Chicago.\\nTo live in Pullman, you had to be employed by the Pullman company that\\nmade passenger cars for the railroads. Nearly nine thousand Pullman employees\\nand their families were lodged in identical houses, built around a park and a lake.\\nPullman was a model for environmental planning long before the word\\n“environment” had entered the popular vocabulary. The lake served as a cooling\\nbasin for the factory power supply. Sewage from the town’s toilets was used for\\nfertilizer.\\nThe schools were good, the landscaping was nice, the people were well taken\\ncare of, so Pullman was a happy town, until the train car business went sour and\\nthe company stopped making money. Pullman did what anybody does who stops\\nmaking money. It cut back on expenses, including wages and benefits for the\\nworkers. The workers got mad and went on strike. The strike and the bitter\\nfeelings against the company destroyed the town. In the end, the company sold\\nthe houses and the rest of the buildings, and eventually the whole operation was\\nshut down. Pullman went bankrupt.\\nThere’s a danger to having companies provide housing, education, medical\\ncare, and the other life-support systems that people depend on. As long as the\\ncompany is doing well, it has no problem providing social services, but what if it\\nfalters? Then it has two choices. It can lay off workers and cut back on its\\nspending to stop the flow of red ink, in which case the schools, hospitals, and\\nparks may have to be shut down so the company can survive. Or it can keep all\\nthe services going and spend itself out of business and into bankruptcy.\\nCapitalism works best when a company that’s losing money has a chance to\\ntry to turn things around, and if that doesn’t happen, it can put itself out of its\\nmisery. That way, unproductive businesses can die, and the workers can go on to\\nsome other industry that’s healthier. But when a company has a second role as\\nthe doctor, teacher, and caretaker for its workers, then it may have to stay in\\nbusiness just so its employees can continue to get all their benefits.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='That’s one of the reasons communism broke down and socialism has\\nproblems. Communist businesses weren’t really businesses at all. They existed\\nbecause the communist bosses, also known as central planners, decided they\\nshould exist. For instance, the Russian central planners liked the idea of building\\nsteel plants, and at one point, the Russians got very good at making steel. There\\nwere steel plants all over the place.\\nMeanwhile, there were very few factories that made shoes or clothes for the\\npeople. This created shortages and long lines at the shoe and clothing outlets.\\nThere was a huge potential market for consumer goods in Russia, and people\\nwould have been delighted to have more to eat and more to wear, but the\\nplanners didn’t care. They built more steel plants. Maybe they thought millions\\nof Russians would start wearing steel pants.\\nIn a communist economy, all the resources—everything that’s made, bought,\\nor sold—are controlled by a small group of managers. In a capitalist economy, if\\nthere are too many steel plants, we’ll have an oversupply of steel, the price will\\ngo down, the steel companies will lose money, people will stop buying steel\\nstocks, and the banks will stop lending money to the steel companies. The steel\\nplants will be forced to cut back their production, and without money to expand,\\nthey’ll stop expanding.\\nConsequently, the money that isn’t invested in steel companies will be used\\nelsewhere, to build shoe factories, jeans factories, malls, water slides, or housing\\ndevelopments—products that haven’t saturated the market and are still in\\ndemand. Smith’s Invisible Hand has never lost its touch.\\nKarl Marx\\nThe most influential communist economic theories came out of the head of Karl\\nMarx, a philosopher who was born in 1818. Marx was German, but he developed\\nmost of his ideas in London, where his wife and children were stuck in a cold\\napartment with little to eat. Even though his favorite subject was economics, he\\nwas a dunce at personal finance.\\nMarx tried to reduce capitalism to a formula, the way Newton did with\\ngravity. His book Das Kapital became the Bible of communists everywhere, and\\noutside the Bible, one could argue it was the most influential book ever written.\\nIt convinced Lenin and other influential Russians to set up a communist state\\nafter they won the Russian Revolution.\\nAccording to Marx, capitalism was doomed, because as business grew, and', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='more and more people were harnessed to machines, the value of their labor was\\nbound to decline. Workers of the world would be required to work longer and\\nlonger hours for less and less pay, until eventually they would get mad and burn\\ndown the factories and join the Communist party.\\nIt’s true that it was no fun to work in a factory at the time Marx was writing\\nhis book. Factories were dark, noisy, dirty, and dangerous. Women and children\\nwere forced to put in twelve to eighteen hours a day tending the machines, and\\nthey earned very little for their efforts. Some were herded into factories against\\ntheir will, and many caught diseases there. The air was polluted from the\\nsmokestacks that blackened the sky with soot.\\nMarx saw all this and hated what he saw (even though his family was no\\nbetter off than the average factory worker’s), and he was determined to prove\\nthat the misery in the factories wouldn’t last. But his theories were totally out of\\nwhack. Instead of people having to work harder and harder for less and less\\nmoney, their hours got shorter and their paychecks got bigger, because factories\\ninstalled updated equipment, which enabled each worker to produce more\\nmerchandise in the same amount of time.\\nWith more efficient machinery, the workers’ time became more valuable, not\\nless, and the factories could afford to raise the workers’ wages. These wages\\nweren’t always raised without a fight, but often enough, they were raised, and\\ninstead of the working class being doomed the way Marx said it was, the\\nworking conditions got cleaned up a bit, and the workers took home more cash.\\nThat’s how prosperity came to the countries with the most factories—England,\\nthe United States, and those of Western Europe—while the rest of the world was\\nstuck in a rut with a few land barons owning everything.\\nSo much for Marx and his fancy equations. It was communism that was\\ndoomed, because the standard of living in communist countries continued to\\ndecline, while in capitalist countries, it continued to rise. It was the Russian and\\nEastern European workers who eventually overthrew the communist system, in\\nfavor of ours.\\nBefore the Famous Crash of 1929\\nJust before the famous Crash of 1929, Wall Street was a busy place, especially\\nfor clerks, because most of the paperwork was done with primitive tools such as\\nadding machines and typewriters.

Exxon alone is worth more\\nthan $87 billion. It has more shareholders than any other public company.\\nIn 1929, AT&T had the most shareholders. It was the biggest company in the\\nworld, but the railroads were still the biggest industry, followed by oil, and then\\nsteel.

They paid a nice, steady dividend, a role later taken\\nover by the electric utilities.\\nLike AT&T, the railroads held up pretty well during the Crash, but they\\ndidn’t do so well on the rebound. Few economists and fewer fortune-tellers\\nwould have predicted that in the long run, railroads would lose their leading role\\nand shrink into the shadows of public life, and that their stocks would be\\nmediocre investments for decades to come. Whether a stock is good or bad\\ndepends entirely on the time frame.\\nThe auto industry that would contribute so much to the decline of the\\nrailroads had caught the attention of investors. Its development was typical of a\\nnew enterprise. At the outset, auto manufacturing was a mom-and-pop business,\\nand cars were made in garages across the country. At the turn of the century,\\nauto manufacturers were located in New England, the Middle Atlantic states, and\\nthe Midwest.\\nAlong came Henry Ford, who put cars on the assembly line and mass-\\nproduced them, just as Duke had done with cigarettes and Heinz with pickles. He\\nmade a generic car of high quality with a low price, and the public loved it. They\\nbought all the Model Ts that Ford could make, but they couldn’t buy the stock,\\nbecause Ford was private, owned by Ford, his family and friends, and nobody\\nelse. On the other hand, General Motors was a public company, and by 1929, it\\nwas a popular stock to own. So popular, in fact, that investors had made it the\\nthird largest, behind AT&T and U.S. Steel. While Ford was sticking with the\\nModel T, GM made a variety of models to give customers a choice. In fact, GM\\nroared past Ford, but Ford saw the light and added new models of its own.\\nLesser competitors in the industry were Chrysler, Hudson, and Nash.\\nBy now, chain stores were familiar sights in cities and towns across America.\\nThe most prominent was Woolworth from Pennsylvania, founded in the\\nnineteenth century and the earliest variety chain on record, followed by\\nMcCrory, Kress, and Kresge.

The leading food companies of 1929 were United Fruit,\\nNational Dairy Products, and Borden. General Mills and Pillsbury Flour Mills\\nwere relative newcomers in the cereal and baking businesses. The total value of\\nCoca-Cola’s stock was $134 million; Wrigley’s, $136 million; Gillette’s, $226\\nmillion, and Procter & Gamble’s, $345 million. To put this in perspective, in\\n1994 Coke made a profit of almost $7 million a day!\\nSears was the dominant force in retailing, followed by its longtime rival,\\nMontgomery Ward, which customers liked to call Monkey Ward. Woolworth\\nhad a nationwide network of its five-and-tencent stores, where everything sold\\nfor a dime or less.\\nSuburbs had begun to spring up around cities, but there were no malls in the\\nsuburbs, because the roads and highways hadn’t been built to connect one suburb\\nto another. Out of Boston, for instance, you could get from downtown to\\nBrookline or to Natick on a train or a trolley car, but there was no way to get\\nfrom Brookline to Natick. So if there had been a mall in Brookline, only the\\nresidents of Brookline could have reached it. Roads were lacking, and cars were\\nin short supply.\\nPeople went shopping in the cities, in the downtown department stores, or in\\nthe towns and villages at the local mom-and-pop stores where the prices were\\nhigh and the merchandise was limited, or if they lived far out in the boondocks,\\nthey shopped from the Ward catalogue or the Sears catalogue.\\nToday there’s a store on every corner and a new mall at every other exit on\\nthe turnpike, so it’s hard to imagine that a single retailer could win the hearts of\\nshoppers the way Sears did. In remote areas of the country, Sears was much\\nmore than a mail-order catalogue. It was a source of excitement and a relief from\\nboredom, and to its millions of devoted followers, Sears was nothing less than a\\ncommercial godsend. The governor of Georgia, Eugene Talmadge, in a\\ncampaign pitch to area farmers, once said: “Your only friends are Jesus Christ,\\nSears Roebuck, and Gene Talmadge.”\\nFast-growing small companies come out of nowhere to become the billion-\\ndollar companies of tomorrow.

A few lesser-known\\nbrokerage houses went bankrupt, but the majority stayed in business. In those\\ndays, people could buy stocks for 10 percent down, which is why the Crash\\nwiped them out. They ended up owing much more money than they had invested\\nin the first place. The brokerage houses had to collect on these debts, and they\\nwent after their customers’ assets with a vengeance. Wall Street firms also\\nbought stocks on borrowed money, but the banks that loaned it to them were\\nsympathetic and gave them extra time to pay their bills. Individual investors\\nweren’t so lucky.\\nFear of Crashing\\nNo event in American history has worried more people over a longer stretch of\\ntime than the Crash of 1929. People who weren’t even born in 1929 were\\nworried about it. The children of people who weren’t born in 1929 have worried\\nabout it as well.\\nThe United States has managed to survive a Civil War, a Revolutionary War,\\ntwo world wars, Korea, Vietnam, and many smaller deadly conflicts. We’ve\\nsurvived the Chicago fire, the San Francisco earthquake and fire, the Los\\nAngeles earthquake, plus numerous lesser earthquakes and dozens of major and\\nminor hurricanes. We’ve survived typhoid epidemics, tuberculosis epidemics,\\nthe polio epidemic, droughts, floods, riots, work stoppages, and the St.\\nValentine’s Day massacre. But we have not yet gotten over the 1929 stock\\nmarket crash.\\nIt’s the most pernicious collective phobia on record, and it has kept millions\\nof people from buying stocks and making a profit they could have used. The idea\\nstill lurks in the back of many brains that the stock market is headed for another\\ncrash that will wipe out everybody’s life savings, and the suckers who put in\\ntheir money will be roaming the streets, wearing old blankets, sleeping in\\nhomeless shelters, eating cold beans, and selling apples and pencils. That’s what\\npeople said in the 1930s: “Uncle Joe is out selling apples and pencils.” It was a\\nmajor industry in those days.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='Of course, there could be another crash. We had a big one in 1987, a smaller\\none in 1981–82, and another big one in 1973–74, but stocks bounced back, as\\nthey always do, eventually. Looking at the positive side, a crash is a unique\\nopportunity to buy stocks cheap.\\nThe major problem with crashes is how long it takes stocks to recover. The\\nDow Jones Industrial Average hit one thousand in 1972, and at one point ten\\nyears later it fell below eight hundred. Investors’ patience was tested over this\\nstretch, but not as sorely tested as it was after the Crash of 1929. Then, it took\\nnearly twenty-five years for many stocks to recover. That’s when people got\\ntired of waiting and vowed never to buy a stock again.\\nBut that slow recovery can’t be blamed on the Crash itself. It had to do with\\nthe Great Depression. There was nothing really great about it, except the great\\namount of trouble it caused, but we call it that nonetheless. Sometimes we just\\ncall it the Depression, even though there had been many panics and depressions\\nin the preceding century.\\nDuring the Great Depression, which lasted about ten years, money was\\nscarce, and jobs were scarcer. Stores went out of business and the employees lost\\ntheir jobs and their paychecks, which meant they couldn’t buy anything, so more\\nstores went out of business and their employees lost their paychecks. The\\neconomy was falling into a catatonic state. Companies couldn’t earn a profit, and\\nwhen that happened, the stock prices went down and stayed down.\\nMost historians will tell you the Depression wasn’t caused by the Crash of\\n1929, although it often gets blamed as the cause. Only a tiny percentage of\\nAmericans owned stocks at the time, so the vast majority of people didn’t lose a\\npenny in the Crash. The Depression was brought about by a worldwide\\neconomic slowdown, coupled with the government’s mishandling of the money\\nsupply and raising interest rates at the wrong time. Instead of putting more cash\\ninto circulation to perk up the economy, our government did just the opposite,\\npulling cash out of circulation. The economy came to a screeching halt.\\nFortunately for posterity, the government learned from this mistake. Now\\nwhen the economy slows, the government is quick to pump up the cash supply\\nand lower the interest rates so there’s more money around and it’s less expensive\\nto take out a loan. Cheaper loans encourage people to buy houses and make other\\nexpensive purchases and encourage businesses to expand. A good jolt of home\\nbuying and business expansion can shock the economy into action.

So in the last fifty years or so, the\\nodds of a slowdown turning into a depression have been quite remote—in fact,\\nthey’ve been zero in nine chances. Nobody can be sure you’ll never see a\\ndepression in your lifetime, but so far, in the past half-century, you would have\\ngone broke betting on one.\\nIs it possible that we’ve found a permanent cure for economic depression, the\\nway we have for polio? There are several reasons to think so. First, the\\ngovernment, through its Federal Reserve Bank system, stands ready to lower\\ninterest rates and pump money into the economy any time it begins to look\\nsluggish and to jolt it back into action. Second, we’ve got millions of people on\\nsocial security and pensions, with money to spend no matter what. Add in the 18\\nmillion employees of government at all levels, from federal to local, and you’ve\\ngot an army of spenders. As long as this huge group is throwing its money\\naround, the economy can slow, but it can’t come to a complete halt, the way it\\ndid in the 1930s.\\nThird, we’ve got deposit insurance at the banks and the savings and loans, so\\nif the banks go bankrupt, people won’t lose all their money. In the 1930s, when\\nhundreds of banks shut their doors, their depositors lost everything. That in itself\\nwas enough to drive the country into a catatonic state.\\nThe big change that underlies all these other changes is the government’s rise\\nto stardom. Today, it has the leading role in the economy, whereas in the 1930s\\nit had only a supporting role, and before the 1900s, it was a bit player. When you\\nhear people complain about big government that’s ruining our lives, remember\\nit’s the same big government that runs the air traffic control and keeps the planes\\nfrom colliding, and whose massive spending power keeps us from going into a\\nsecond Great Depression.\\nIf you buy the argument that we’re not likely to suffer a relapse into\\ndepression, then you can be a little more relaxed about drops in the stock market.\\nAs long as the economy is alive and kicking, companies can make money. If\\ncompanies are making money, their stocks won’t go to zero. The majority will\\nsurvive until the next period of prosperity, when stock prices will come back.\\nHistory doesn’t have to repeat itself. When somebody tells you that it does,\\nremind him or her that we haven’t had a depression in more than a half-century.\\nPeople who stay out of stocks to avoid a 1929-style tragedy are missing out on\\nall the benefits of owning stocks, and that’s a bigger tragedy.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='Folk Tales from the Crash\\nA lot of hoodoo, folk tales, and nonsense have been passed along from\\ngeneration to generation about the Crash of 1929. You may have heard the one\\nabout all the distraught investors committing suicide by jumping out of windows\\nof tall buildings in New York. But according to a book called 1929: The Year of\\nthe Great Crash, by William Klingaman, there was no increase in the national\\nsuicide rate in the weeks following the calamity on Wall Street; only a few\\npeople jumped from windows, and not necessarily because they lost money in\\nstocks.\\nThe vice-president of Earl Radio Corporation leaped to his death from the\\neleventh floor of the Hotel Shelton on Lexington Avenue, but that was in early\\nOctober, a couple of weeks before the Crash. On October 24, a few days after\\nthe Crash, a crowd gathered around a construction project where a man was\\nsitting on a girder. They thought he was a prominent investor about to do himself\\nin, but he turned out to be a construction worker having his lunch.\\nBritish statesman Winston Churchill was staying at the Savoy Plaza Hotel,\\ndirectly under a room where another man hurtled himself out a window fifteen\\nstories to the ground and was dashed to pieces. This incident was counted as a\\nstock market fatality, although there was no evidence it had anything to do with\\nstocks. Most of the business types who committed suicide during this period shot\\nthemselves, stuck their heads into ovens, or chose other methods besides\\njumping out of windows without a bungee cord.\\nFor instance, James Riordan of the County Trust Company bank put a bullet\\ninto his head; Harry Crew Crosby, a married man, died in an opium orgy with\\nhis girlfriend (this was publicized as a Wall Street scandal, because Crosby was\\nthe son of an investment banker at J. P. Morgan, but he was a writer and had\\nnothing to do with the bank, nor did the bank have anything to do with him); the\\nwife of a Long Island stockbroker shot herself in the heart (nobody knows why\\nshe didn’t shoot him); an electric utility executive in Rochester, New York,\\ngassed himself in his bathroom; a Philadelphia financier shot himself in his\\nathletic club; a Providence, Rhode Island, investor dropped dead in his broker’s\\noffice watching the tickertape; a Milwaukee investor turned a gun on himself\\nand left a note that said: “My body should go to science, my soul to Andrew W.\\nMellon (the famous Pittsburgh tycoon) and sympathy to my creditors.”\\nSo where did we get the idea that victims of the Crash were throwing\\nthemselves off ledges in New York? The main source seems to be comedian', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='Will Rogers. Soon after the Crash, Rogers said, “The situation has been reached\\nin New York hotels where the clerk asks incoming guests, ‘You wanna room for\\nsleeping or for jumping?’ And you have to stand in line to get a window to jump\\nout of.”\\nBut Rogers was just trying to get a laugh. He could afford to make jokes,\\nbecause he followed the advice of another famous Wall Street tycoon, Bernard\\nBaruch. Baruch was smart enough to get out of stocks entirely before the market\\ncrashed, and Rogers did likewise. Other entertainers, such as Eddie Cantor and\\nGroucho Marx, weren’t so lucky.\\nThe real victims of the Crash were the people who bought stocks with\\nborrowed money, or “margin.” In those days, you were allowed to invest with\\nonly 10 percent down. So if you had $10,000 you could borrow $90,000 and buy\\n$100,000 worth of stocks.

Money was\\nscarce and millions of people lost their jobs, so by and large, conditions were\\npretty bad. But for certain companies, and their employees and investors,\\nbusiness was OK.\\nThe A&P grocery store company is a prime example. When everybody else\\nwas closing stores, the A&P was bucking the trend and opening new ones. It\\ngrew its sales and its earnings, because no matter how bad things got, people still\\nhad to buy groceries. The national income had fallen by half from 1928 to 1933,\\nbut whatever income they had left, people were spending on food.\\nCertain kinds of companies can ride out depressions and recessions and other\\nperiods when money is scarce. These are called consumer growth companies.\\nThey sell inexpensive items: beer, soft drinks, snacks, and so forth, or\\nnecessities, such as medicines that people can’t live without. Chewing gum and\\ncandy companies, such as Wrigley’s, can thrive on recessions, because as Mr.\\nWrigley himself once said: “The sadder they are, the more the people chew.”\\nSo it should have been no surprise that Business Week magazine reported in\\n1932 that A&P was in fine shape.

It was the Piggly-Wiggly\\nthreat they had to worry about. A merchant in Memphis, Tennessee, had opened\\nthe original Piggly-Wiggly self-service store. Instead of asking the clerk behind\\nthe counter to pick items off the shelf, the Piggly-Wiggly shopper could roam\\nthe aisles and grab what she wanted (most shoppers were shes in those days) and\\nbring it to the checkout line. This was new. Self-service meant that stores could\\noperate with fewer clerks, and shoppers could be exposed to more items.\\nThis was a dramatic moment for A&P. If the company’s management had left\\nwell enough alone and ignored the challenge of Piggly-Wiggly, A&P would\\nhave gone the way of the dinosaurs. This is often the case with companies:\\nDepressions they can handle, wars they can handle, the hole in the ozone layer\\ndoesn’t bother them, but competition can do them in.\\nA company must quickly adapt to changes in the market, or it won’t survive.\\nA&P saw what it had to do and did it. It closed thousands of its small shops and\\nopened a few supermarkets of its own.\\nIn 1935, there were only ninety-six supermarkets in the entire country, and\\nonly twenty-four cities had one.

They dump their entire\\nportfolio in a panic. A stock they acquired for one hundred dollars when it was\\noverpriced, they unload a few weeks later for seventy dollars or sixty dollars, at\\na bargain price. Their loss is the new buyers’ gain, because the new buyers will\\nmake the money the sellers would have made if they’d held on to their\\ninvestments and waited out the correction.\\nThere were so many sellers during the brutal stock-market correction of the\\nearly 1970s that 5 million former shareholders, 3 percent of the population,\\nexited the market en masse. It took five years for enough people to come back to\\nstocks so that once again, the United States had 30 million shareholders.\\nBy the mid-1980s, the ranks of shareholders had swollen to 47 million. One\\nout of five Americans owned stocks, and 33 percent of those owners had\\ninvested through mutual funds. The market value of all stocks on the NYSE\\npassed the $1 trillion mark.\\nBy 1990, there were 51.4 million shareholders, an all-time record, and the\\nnumber of people who invested through mutual funds had quadrupled in a\\ndecade. The average investor was no longer interested in picking his or her own\\nstocks. The job was turned over to the professional fund managers at the nearly\\nfour thousand funds in existence at the time.\\nThe typical shareholder in 1990 was a forty-five-year-old man or a forty-four-\\nyear-old woman.

Let’s examine these one at a time.\\n1. Savings Accounts, Money-Market Funds, Treasury Bills, and Certificates of\\nDeposit (CDs)\\nAll of the above are known as short-term investments. They have some\\nadvantages. They pay you interest. You get your money back in a relatively short\\ntime. In savings accounts, Treasury bills, and CDs, your money is insured\\nagainst losses, so you’re guaranteed to get it back. (Money markets lack the\\nguarantee, but the chances of losing money in a money market are remote.)\\nShort-term investments have one big disadvantage. They pay you a low rate of\\ninterest. Sometimes, the interest rate you get in a money-market account or a\\nsavings account can’t even keep up with inflation. Looking at it that way, a\\nsavings account may be a losing proposition.\\nInflation is a fancy way of saying that prices of things are going up. When gas\\ngoes from $1.10 a gallon to $1.40, or a movie ticket from $4.00 to $5.00, that’s\\ninflation. Another way to look at inflation is that the buying power of the dollar\\nis going down.\\nIn recent times, inflation has been running just below 3 percent, which means\\nfor every dollar you own, you’re losing three cents every year. This adds up very\\nquickly, and in ten years, at the present rate of inflation, all your dollars will\\nhave had thirty cents taken out of them.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='The first goal of saving and investing is to keep ahead of inflation. Your\\nmoney’s on a treadmill that’s constantly going backward. In recent years, you\\nhad to make 3 percent on your investments just to stay even.\\nAs the chart on page 101 clearly indicates, money markets and savings\\naccounts often don’t pay enough interest to make up for the losses from\\ninflation.

The\\nmoney is safe in the short run, because it’s insured against loss, but in the long\\nrun, it’s likely to lose ground against taxes and inflation. Here’s a tip—when the\\ninflation rate is higher than the interest rate you’re getting from a CD, Treasury\\nbill, money-market account, or savings account, you’re investing in a lost cause.\\nSavings accounts are great places to park money so you can get at it quickly,\\nwhenever you need to pay bills. They are great places to store cash until you’ve\\ngot a big enough pile to invest elsewhere. But over long periods of time, they\\nwon’t do you much good.\\n2. Collectibles\\nCollectibles can be anything from antique cars to stamps, old coins, baseball\\ncards, or Barbie dolls. When you invest your money in such things, you are\\nhoping to sell them at a profit in the future. There are two reasons this might\\nhappen: The things become more desirable as they get older, and people are\\nwilling to pay higher prices for them; and inflation robs cash of its buying\\npower, which raises prices across the board.\\nThe trouble with investing in things is they can get lost, stolen, warped,\\nstained, ripped, or damaged by fire, water, wind, or in the case of antique\\nfurniture, termites. There is insurance for some of this, but insurance is\\nexpensive. Things in general lose value with wear and tear, although they also\\nincrease in value as they get older. That’s the constant hope of collectors, that\\nthe age of the thing will raise its price more than the condition of the thing will\\nlower it.\\nCollecting is a very specialized business, and successful collectors are experts\\nnot only in the items they collect, but also in the market and the prices. There’s a\\nlot to learn. Some of it you can pick up from books, and the rest you get the hard\\nway, by experience.\\nLesson one for all potential collectors, particularly young collectors, is that\\nbuying a new car is not an investment. The word “investment” showed up in a\\nrecent TV ad for a car, but if you see this ad, don’t be swayed by it. Antique cars\\nare investments, if they are kept in a garage and rarely driven, but new cars\\nsubjected to everyday use lose their value faster, even, than money does.\\nNothing will eat up your bankroll faster than a car will—unless it’s a boat. Don’t', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='make the mistake that Bigbelly did.\\n3. Houses or Apartments\\nBuying a house or an apartment is the most profitable purchase most people ever\\nmake. A house has two big advantages over other types of investments. You can\\nlive in it while you wait for the price to go up, and you buy it on borrowed\\nmoney. Let’s review the math.\\nHouses have a habit of increasing in value at the same rate as inflation. On\\nthat score, you’re breaking even. But you don’t pay for the house all at once.\\nTypically, you pay 20 percent up front (the down payment), and a bank lends\\nyou the other 80 percent (the mortgage). You pay interest on this mortgage for as\\nlong as it takes you to pay back the loan. That could be as long as fifteen or\\nthirty years, depending on the deal you make with the bank.\\nMeanwhile, you’re living in the house, and you won’t get scared out of it by a\\nbad housing market, the way you might get scared out of stocks when the stock\\nmarket has a crash or a correction. As long as you stay there, the house increases\\nin value, but you aren’t paying any taxes on the gains. And once in your lifetime,\\nthe government gives you a tax break when you do sell the house.\\nIf you buy a $100,000 house that increases in value by 3 percent a year, after\\nthe first year it will be worth $3,000 more than what you paid for it. At first\\nglance, you’d say that’s a 3 percent return, the same as you might get from a\\nsavings account. But here’s the secret that makes a house such a great\\ninvestment. Of the $100,000 it takes to buy the house, only $20,000 comes out\\nof your pocket. So, at the end of year one, you’ve got a $3,000 profit on an\\ninvestment of $20,000. Instead of a 3 percent return, the house is giving you a 15\\npercent return.\\nAlong the way, of course, you have to pay the interest on the mortgage, but\\nyou get a tax break for that (unless the government decides to take away the tax\\nbreak), and as you pay off the mortgage, you’re increasing your investment in\\nthe house. This is a form of savings that people often don’t think about.\\nFifteen years up the road, if you’ve got a fifteen-year mortgage and you stay\\nin the house that long, the mortgage is paid off, and the house you bought for\\n$100,000 is worth $155,797, thanks to the annual 3 percent increase in the price.\\nLet’s pick up where we left off with Joe Bigbelly and Sally Cartwheel.\\nThey’ve both moved up to assistant manager at WalMart, making identical\\nsalaries. Cartwheel is living in her own house, while Bigbelly’s parents have', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='kicked him out of theirs. He would have preferred to buy a house or an\\napartment on his own, but since he lacked a down payment, he had no choice but\\nto rent an apartment.\\nBigbelly’s monthly rent is somewhat lower than Cartwheel’s monthly\\nmortgage payment, plus she has to buy home insurance, pay the lawn service,\\nand make the occasional repair. So Bigbelly has more cash in his pocket at the\\noutset. In theory, he could take this extra cash and invest it in the stock market\\nand build up his assets for the future, but he doesn’t. He spends it on stereo\\nequipment, scuba gear, golf lessons, and so on.\\nA person who won’t save money to buy an apartment or a house isn’t likely\\nto save money to invest in stocks. It’s routine for families to make sacrifices so\\nthey can afford to own a house eventually, but when have you ever heard of a\\nfamily making sacrifices so it could buy its first mutual fund?\\nBy owning a house, Cartwheel already has gotten into the habit of saving and\\ninvesting. As long as she’s paying the mortgage, she’s forced to invest in the\\nhouse, and since she already invested in mutual funds to secure the down\\npayment, there’s a good chance she’ll invest in mutual funds in the future,\\nwhenever she has money to spare.\\nIn fifteen years, when her mortgage is paid off, Cartwheel will be living in a\\nvaluable asset, and her biggest monthly bill will have disappeared. Bigbelly will\\nhave nothing to show for all his rent payments, which will be much higher than\\nthey were when he first moved into the apartment. They will also be much\\nhigher than the final payment Sally Cartwheel had to make.\\n4. Bonds\\nYou’ve probably heard newscasters talk about “the bond market,” “the rally in\\nbonds,” or “the decline in bond prices across the board.” Maybe you know\\npeople who own bonds. Maybe you’ve wondered, “What is a bond?”\\nA bond is a glorified IOU. It’s printed on fancy paper with doodles around the\\nborder and artwork at the top, but its purpose is no different from the purpose of\\nthe IOU that’s scrawled on a napkin. It’s a record of the fact that you’ve loaned\\nyour money to somebody else. It shows the amount of the loan and the deadline\\nfor paying it back. It gives the interest rate that the borrower has to pay.\\nEven though it’s called “buying a bond,” when you purchase one, you aren’t\\nreally buying anything. You’re simply making a loan. The seller of the bond,\\nalso called the issuer, is borrowing your money, and the bond itself is proof that', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='the deal happened.\\nThe biggest seller of bonds in the world is Uncle Sam. Whenever the U.S.\\ngovernment needs extra cash (which these days is all the time), it prints up a new\\nbatch. That’s what the $5 trillion national debt is all about—it’s owed to all the\\npeople who’ve bought the government’s bonds. Individuals and companies here\\nand abroad, even foreign governments, have loaned the $5 trillion to Uncle Sam.\\nThey’ve got the IOUs in their safety deposit boxes to prove it.\\nEventually, these people have to be paid back—that’s what the deficit crisis is\\nall about. In the meantime, the government has to pay the interest on the $5\\ntrillion worth of loans—Uncle Sam is going broke trying to keep up with these\\npayments. This is the mess we’ve gotten ourselves into. The government owes\\nso much to so many that more than 15 percent of all the federal taxes goes to\\npaying the interest.\\nThe type of bond that young people are most likely to get involved in is the\\nU.S. Savings Bond. Grandparents are famous for giving savings bonds as gifts to\\ntheir grandchildren. It’s a round-about way of putting money in their\\ngrandchildren’s pockets. Instead of handing them the money directly, the\\ngrandparents lend it to the government, by purchasing the bond. Over the years,\\nthe government pays back the money, plus interest—not to the grandparents, but\\nto the grandchildren.\\nThe U.S. government is not the only seller of bonds, in spite of its constant\\nneed for money. State and local governments also sell bonds to raise cash. So do\\nhospitals and airports, school districts and sports stadiums, public agencies of all\\nkinds, and thousands of companies. Bonds are in abundant supply. They’re for\\nsale in any stockbroker’s office. You can buy them as easily as you can open a\\nsavings account or buy a share of stock.\\nBasically, a bond is quite similar to the CDs and the Treasury bills we’ve\\nalready talked about. You buy them for the interest you’ll get, and you know in\\nadvance how much interest you’ll be paid and how often, and when you’ll get\\nyour original investment back. The main difference between bonds and CDs or\\nTreasury bills is that with CDs and Treasuries, you get paid back sooner (the\\nperiod varies from a few months to a couple of years), and with bonds you get\\npaid back later (you might have to wait five years, ten years, or as long as thirty\\nyears).\\nThe longer it takes for bonds to pay off, the greater the risk that inflation will\\neat up the value of your money before you get it back. That’s why bonds pay a\\nhigher rate of interest than the short-term alternatives, such as CDs, savings', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='accounts, or the money market. Investors demand to be rewarded for taking the\\ngreater risk.\\nAll else being equal, a thirty-year bond pays more interest than a ten-year\\nbond, which in turn pays more interest than a five-year bond, and so on. The\\nbuyers of bonds have to decide how far out they want to go, and whether the\\nextra money they make in interest on, say, a thirty-year bond is worth the risk of\\nhaving their money tied up for that long. These are difficult decisions.\\nAt current count, more than $8 trillion worth of bonds of all varieties are\\nowned by investors in the United States, making bonds a more popular\\ninvestment than stocks. Meanwhile, investors also own more than $7 trillion\\nworth of stocks traded on the major exchanges (and that doesn’t count the ones\\ntraded in regional or pink-sheets exchanges), and there’s a continuing debate\\nover the merits of one versus the other. Both have their good points and their bad\\npoints. Stocks are riskier than bonds, and potentially far more rewarding. To\\nunderstand why this is true, let’s look at two choices: one where you buy\\nMcDonald’s stock, and the other where you buy a McDonald’s bond.\\nWhen you buy the stock, you’re an owner of the company with all rights and\\nprivileges. McDonald’s makes a bit of a fuss over you. They send you their\\nreports, and they invite you to the annual meetings. They also pay you a bonus,\\nin the form of a dividend. If they have a really good year at their sixteen\\nthousand hamburger stands, they might raise the dividend, so you get an even\\nbigger bonus. But even without the dividend, if McDonald’s sells another zillion\\nBig Macs and all goes well, the stock price will rise. You can sell your stock for\\nmore than you paid for it and make money that way.\\nNevertheless, there are no guarantees that McDonald’s will prosper, that\\nyou’ll get a bonus, or that the stock price will rise. If it falls to less than what you\\npaid for it, McDonald’s won’t reimburse you. They haven’t promised anything,\\nand they aren’t obliged to pay you back. As an owner of the stock, you don’t\\nhave a safety net. You must proceed at your own risk.\\nWhen you buy a McDonald’s bond, or any bond, for that matter, it’s a much\\ndifferent story. In that case, you’re not an owner. You’re a lender, giving\\nMcDonald’s the use of your money for a fixed period of time.\\nMcDonald’s can have the greatest year in hamburger history, and if you’re a\\nbondholder, they won’t even think about sending you a bonus. Companies are\\nconstantly raising the dividend on their stock to reward the stockholders, but\\nyou’ll never hear of a company raising the interest rates on its bonds to reward\\nthe bondholders.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='The worst part about being a bondholder is watching the stock go through the\\nroof and knowing that you won’t see a penny of the gain. McDonald’s is a\\nperfect example. Since the 1960s, the stock (adjusted for splits) has soared from\\n$22.50 to $13,570 and investors have made 603 times their money, turning $100\\ninto $60,300 or $1,000 into $603,000. The people who bought McDonald’s\\nbonds were hardly as fortunate. They collected interest payments along the way,\\nbut aside from that, they broke even.\\nIf you buy a $10,000 ten-year bond and hold it for ten years, you get your\\nmoney back plus interest, and nothing more. Actually, you get back much less\\nbecause of inflation. Let’s say the bond is paying 8 percent a year, and the\\ninflation rate over that ten-year period is 4 percent. Even though you’ve\\ncollected $8,000 in interest payments, you’ve lost almost $1,300 to inflation.\\nYour original $10,000 investment is now worth $6,648 after ten years of 4\\npercent annual inflation. So the whole ten-year investment has left you with less\\nthan a 3 percent annual return, and that’s before taxes. If you figure in the taxes,\\nyour return approaches zero.\\nThe good thing about a bond is that even though you miss the gain when the\\nstock goes up, you also miss the loss when the stock goes down. If McDonald’s\\nstock had gone from $13,570 to $22.50 instead of the other way around,\\nstockholders would be crying and bondholders would be laughing, because\\nMcDonald’s bonds aren’t affected by the stock price. No matter what happens in\\nthe stock market, the company must repay its debts to the bondholders on the\\ndate when the loans terminate and the bonds “come due.”\\nThat’s why a bond is less risky than a stock. There’s a guarantee attached to\\nit. When you buy a bond, you know in advance exactly how much you’ll be\\ngetting in interest payments, and you won’t lie awake nights worrying where the\\nstock price is headed. Your investment is protected, at least more protected than\\nwhen you buy a stock.\\nStill, there are three ways you can get hurt by a bond. The first danger occurs\\nif you sell the bond before the due date, when the issuer of the bond must repay\\nyou in full. By selling early, you take your chances in the bond market, where\\nthe prices of bonds go up and down daily, the same as stocks. So, if you get out\\nof a bond prematurely, you might get less than you paid for it.\\nThe second danger occurs when the issuer of the bond goes bankrupt and\\ncan’t pay you back. The chances of this happening depend on who is doing the\\nissuing. The U.S. government, for example, will never go bankrupt—it can print\\nmore money whenever it wants. Therefore, the buyers of U.S. government bonds', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='are repaid in full. It’s an ironclad guarantee.\\nOther issuers of bonds, from hospitals to airports to corporations, can’t\\nalways offer such a guarantee. If they go bankrupt, the owners of the bonds can\\nlose a lot of money. Usually, they get something back, but not their entire\\ninvestment. And sometimes, they lose the whole amount.\\nWhen an issuer of a bond fails to make the required payments, it’s called a\\ndefault. To avoid getting caught in one, smart bond buyers review the financial\\ncondition of the issuer of a bond before they consider buying it. Some bonds are\\ninsured, which is another way the payments can be guaranteed. Also, there are\\nagencies that give safety ratings to bonds, so potential buyers know in advance\\nwhich ones are risky and which aren’t. A strong company such as McDonald’s\\ngets a high safety rating—the chances of McDonald’s defaulting on a bond are\\nclose to zero. A weaker company that has trouble paying its bills will get a low\\nrating. You’ve heard of junk bonds? These are the bonds that get the lowest\\nratings of all.\\nWhen you buy a junk bond, you’re taking a bigger risk that you won’t get\\nyour money back. That’s why junk bonds pay a higher rate of interest than other\\nbonds—the investors are rewarded for taking the extra risk.\\nExcept with the junkiest of junk bonds, defaults are few and far between.\\nThe biggest risk in owning a bond is risk number three: inflation. We’ve\\nalready seen how inflation can wreck an investment. With stocks, over the very\\nlong term, you can keep up with inflation and make a decent profit to boot. With\\nbonds, you can’t.\\n5. Stocks\\nStocks are likely to be the best investment you’ll ever make, outside of a house.\\nYou don’t have to feed a stock, the way you do if you invest in horses or prize\\ncats. It doesn’t break down the way a car does, nor does it leak the way a house\\ncan. You don’t have to keep it mowed, the way you do with real estate. You can\\nlose a baseball card collection to fire, theft, or flood, but you can’t lose a stock.\\nThe certificate that proves you own a stock might be stolen or burned up, but if\\nthat happens, the company will send you another one.\\nWhen you buy a bond, you’re only making a loan, but when you invest in a\\nstock, you’re buying a piece of a company. If the company prospers, you share\\nin the prosperity. If it pays a dividend, you’ll receive it, and if it raises the\\ndividend, you’ll reap the benefit.

People who need to pull their\\nmoney out in one year, two years, or five years shouldn’t invest in stocks in the\\nfirst place. There’s simply no telling what stock prices will do from one year to\\nthe next. When the stock market has one of its “corrections” and stocks lose\\nmoney, the people who have to get their money out may be going home with a\\nlot less than they put in.\\nTwenty years or longer is the right time frame. That’s long enough for stocks\\nto rebound from the nastiest corrections on record, and it’s long enough for the\\nprofits to pile up. Eleven percent a year in total return is what stocks have\\nproduced in the past. Nobody can predict the future, but after twenty years at 11\\npercent, an investment of $10,000 is magically transformed into $80,623.\\nTo get that 11 percent, you have to pledge your loyalty to stocks for better or\\nfor worse—this is a marriage we’re talking about, a marriage between your\\nmoney and your investments. You can be a genius at analyzing which companies\\nto buy, but unless you have the patience and the courage to hold on to the shares,\\nyou’re an odds-on favorite to become a mediocre investor. It’s not always\\nbrainpower that separates good investors from bad; often, it’s discipline.\\nStick with your stocks no matter what, ignore all the “smart advice” that tells\\nyou to do otherwise, and “act like a dumb mule.” That was the advice given fifty\\nyears ago by a former stockbroker, Fred Schwed, in his classic book Where Are\\nthe Customers’ Yachts? and it still applies today.\\nPeople are always looking around for the secret formula for winning on Wall\\nStreet, when all along, it’s staring them in the face: Buy shares in solid\\ncompanies with earning power and don’t let go of them without a good reason.\\nThe stock price going down is not a good reason.\\nIt’s easy enough to stand in front of a mirror and swear that you’re a long-\\nterm investor who will have no trouble staying true to your stocks. Ask any\\ngroup of people how many are long-term investors, and you’ll see a unanimous\\nshow of hands. These days, it’s hard to find anybody who doesn’t claim to be a\\nlong-term investor, but the real test comes when stocks take a dive.\\nMore details on these so-called crashes, corrections, and bear markets can be', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='found later in this book. Nobody can predict exactly when a bear market will\\narrive (although there’s no shortage of Wall Street types who claim to be skilled\\nfortune-tellers in this regard). But when one does arrive, and the prices of nine\\nout of ten stocks drop in unison, many investors naturally get scared.\\nThey hear the TV newscasters using words like “disaster” and “calamity” to\\ndescribe the situation, and they begin to worry that stock prices will hurtle\\ntoward zero and their investment will be wiped out. They decide to rescue\\nwhat’s left of their money by putting their stocks up for sale, even at a loss. They\\ntell themselves that getting something back is better than getting nothing back.\\nIt’s at this point that large crowds of people suddenly become short-term\\ninvestors, in spite of their claims about being long-term investors. They let their\\nemotions get the better of them, and they forget the reason they bought stocks in\\nthe first place—to own shares in good companies. They go into a panic because\\nstock prices are low, and instead of waiting for the prices to come back, they sell\\nat these low prices. Nobody forces them to do this, but they volunteer to lose\\nmoney.\\nWithout realizing it, they’ve fallen into the trap of trying to time the market.\\nIf you told them they were “market timers” they’d deny it, but anybody who\\nsells stocks because the market is up or down is a market timer for sure.\\nA market timer tries to predict the short-term zigs and zags in stock prices,\\nhoping to get out with a quick profit. Few people can make money at this, and\\nnobody has come up with a foolproof method. In fact, if anybody had figured out\\nhow to consistently predict the market, his name (or her name) would already\\nappear at the top of the list of richest people in the world, ahead of Warren\\nBuffett and Bill Gates.\\nTry to time the market and you invariably find yourself getting out of stocks\\nat the moment they’ve hit bottom and are turning back up, and into stocks when\\nthey’ve gone up and are turning back down. People think this happens to them\\nbecause they’re unlucky. In fact, it happens to them because they’re attempting\\nthe impossible. Nobody can outsmart the market.\\nPeople also think it’s dangerous to be invested in stocks during crashes and\\ncorrections, but it’s only dangerous if they sell. They forget the other kind of\\ndanger—not being invested in stocks on those few magical days when prices\\ntake a flying leap.\\nIt’s amazing how a few key days can make or break your entire investment\\nplan. Here’s a typical example. During a prosperous five-year stretch in the\\n1980s, stock prices gained 26.3 percent a year. Disciplined investors who stuck', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='to the plan doubled their money and then some. But most of these gains occurred\\non forty days out of the 1,276 days the stock markets were open for business\\nduring those five years. If you were out of stocks on those forty key days,\\nattempting to avoid the next correction, your 26.3 percent annual gain was\\nreduced to 4.3 percent. A CD in a bank would have returned more than 4.3\\npercent, and at less risk.\\nSo to get the most out of stocks, especially if you’re young and time is on\\nyour side, your best bet is to invest money you can afford to set aside forever,\\nthen leave that money in stocks through thick and thin. You’ll suffer through the\\nbad times, but if you don’t sell any shares, you’ll never take a real loss. By being\\nfully invested, you’ll get the full benefit of those magical and unpredictable\\nstretches when stocks make most of their gains.\\nMutual Funds\\nAt this point, we’ve come to two conclusions: First, you should invest in stocks,\\nif at all possible, and second, you should hold on to these stocks as long as the\\ncompanies behind them continue to do well. The next thing you have to decide is\\nwhether to pick your own stocks or let somebody else do it.\\nThere’s a lot to be said for taking the easy way out, especially if you are\\nbored by numbers and couldn’t care less what happens to Kodak’s earnings, or\\nwhether Nike makes a better shoe than Reebok.\\nThat’s why mutual funds were invented—for people who want to own stocks\\nbut can’t be bothered with the details. In a mutual fund, your only job is to send\\nmoney, which gives you a certain number of shares in the fund. Your money is\\nlumped together with a lot of other people’s money (you never actually meet\\nthem but you know they are out there). The whole pile is handed over to the\\nexpert who manages the fund.\\nAt least you hope there’s an expert in charge, because you’re counting on him\\nor her to figure out which stocks to buy and when to buy them and sell them.\\nA mutual fund has another advantage, besides having a manager who does all\\nthe work. It invests in many companies at once. As soon as you sign up with a\\nfund, you automatically become an owner of the dozens, even hundreds of\\ncompanies the fund has already bought. Whether you invest fifty dollars or $50\\nmillion, you still own a piece of all the stocks in the fund. This is less risky than\\nowning only one stock, which if you’re a novice investor might be all you could\\nafford.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='A typical fund allows you to get started with as little as fifty or one hundred\\ndollars, with the chance to buy more shares whenever extra cash comes into your\\npossession. How much and how often you contribute is up to you. You can take\\nthe guesswork out of it by investing the same amount every month, three\\nmonths, or six months. The interval isn’t important, as long as you keep up the\\nroutine.\\nCan you see the wisdom in this sort of installment plan? Your worries about\\nwhere the stock market is headed from one year to the next are over. In a\\ncorrection or a bear market, the shares in your favorite fund will get cheaper, so\\nyou’ll be buying more at low prices, and in a bull market you’ll be buying more\\nat high prices. Over time, the costs will even out and your profits will mount.\\nAs an added attraction, many funds pay a cash bonus in the form of a\\ndividend. It comes your way on a regular basis—four times a year, twice a year,\\nor even twelve times a year. You can spend this money however you want—on\\nmovie tickets, compact disks, sunglasses—to reward yourself for investing in the\\nfund. Or you can do yourself a bigger favor by using the dividend to buy more\\nshares.\\nThis is called the “reinvestment option,” and once you’ve chosen it, your\\ndividends are reinvested automatically. The more shares you own, the more you\\nstand to gain from the future success of the fund, which is why your money will\\ngrow faster if you throw the dividends into the pot.\\nYou can follow your fund’s progress by looking it up in the newspaper, the\\nsame way you look up Disney or Wendy’s. The price of a share in a fund goes\\nup and down every day, and it moves more or less in lockstep with the prices of\\nall the stocks in the fund’s portfolio. That’s why you want to invest in funds with\\nmanagers who have the knack for picking the right stocks. You’re rooting for the\\nmanagers, because the better they do, the better you do.\\nSaying good-bye to a fund is easy. You can take your money out any time\\nyou want—either all of it or some of it—and the fund will send you a check\\nimmediately. But unless there’s an emergency and you have a sudden need for\\nquick cash, getting out of a fund should be the last thing on your mind. Your\\ngoal is to sell your shares for a much higher price than the price you paid to\\nacquire them, and the longer you stick with the fund, the bigger your potential\\nprofit.\\nAlong with the chance to share in the gains from a fund, you’re also paying a\\nshare of the management fees and the fund’s expenses. These fees and expenses\\nare paid out of the fund’s assets, and they generally cost investors between 0.5', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='percent and 2 percent annually, depending on the fund. That means when you\\nown a mutual fund, you’re starting out every year somewhere between 0.5\\npercent and 2 percent in the hole, and on top of that, the fund must pay a\\ncommission whenever it buys or sells a stock.\\nThe managers are expected to do well in spite of the expenses, by being\\nclever and picking the right stocks.\\nThese professional stockpickers have an advantage over the millions of\\namateurs who do their own picking. It’s a hobby for amateurs, but for the pros,\\nit’s a full-time job. They go to business school to learn how to study companies\\nand decipher financial reports. They’ve got libraries, high-performance\\ncomputers, and a research staff to back them up. If there’s important news out of\\na company, they hear it right away.\\nOn the other hand, professional stockpickers also have limitations that make it\\neasy to compete with them.

They feel comfortable buying the same stocks the other\\nmanagers are buying, and they avoid wandering off into unfamiliar territory. So\\nthey miss the exciting prospects that can be found outside the boundaries of the\\nherd.\\nIn particular, they overlook the newer, inexperienced companies that often\\nturn out to be star performers in business and the biggest winners in the stock\\nmarket.\\nFund History\\nThe earliest mutual fund on record was started in 1822 by King William I of the\\nNetherlands. The idea spread to Scotland, where the thrifty Scots took an\\nimmediate fancy to it. The Scots were regarded as a frugal lot, who frowned on\\nfrivolous purchases. They managed to save enormous quantities of money,\\nwhich could be invested in the newly created funds.\\nEventually, the inhabitants of the United States got wind of mutual funds, but\\nthey didn’t catch on here until the end of the nineteenth century. In those days,\\nmutual funds were called “stock trusts”—the earliest on record being the New\\nYork Stock Trust launched in 1889. The stock trusts evolved into “investment', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='companies,” which were popular in the 1920s.\\nThe first homegrown mutual fund to describe itself that way was the Shaw-\\nLoomis-Sayles fund. It appeared on the scene in November 1929, just weeks\\nafter the stock market crashed. This was bad timing by the organizers, because\\nstock prices continued to drop until they finally hit bottom in 1932. By 1936,\\nafter the dust had settled, half the funds in the country (still called “investment\\ncompanies”) were out of business.\\nInvestors learned an important lesson: When stocks go down in a heap, funds\\ngo down with them. It still applies today. The best fund manager on Wall Street\\ncan’t protect you in a crash, whether it’s the Crash of 1929, 1972–73, 1987,\\n1990, or a future Crash of 2000, 2010, or 2020. Whether you do the investing or\\na professional does it, there’s no such thing as a crash-proof portfolio.\\nEleven years after the Crash of 1929, Congress passed a key piece of\\nlegislation, the Investment Company Act of 1940. This law, still on the books\\ntoday, takes the mystery out of mutual funds. It requires that each fund describe\\nitself in detail, so investors know exactly what they’re getting and how much\\nthey have to pay to get it.\\nEvery mutual fund registered in the United States (more than six thousand at\\npresent count) has to explain its overall strategy and tell you how risky that is. It\\nhas to explain how the money is invested. It has to reveal the contents of its\\nportfolio, listing the biggest holdings by name and how many shares it owns in\\neach.\\nIt has to reveal the management fee, plus any extra fees levied by the\\nmanagement company. It has to report on its gains and losses in previous years,\\nso everybody knows exactly how well or how poorly it has performed in the\\npast.\\nAlong with all these rules that force it to tell the whole truth and nothing but\\nthe truth, a fund must also follow strict rules on investing. It can’t risk more than\\n5 percent of its customers’ money on a single stock. This guards against its\\nputting too many eggs in one basket.\\nMeanwhile, government watchdogs at the Securities and Exchange\\nCommission (SEC) keep up a constant surveillance, so the funds that might\\notherwise be tempted to break the rules are held in check by the fear of getting\\ncaught. Overall, the fund industry does a good job policing itself, and it\\nmaintains a good relationship with the SEC’s tough watchdogs.\\nRecently, with the support of the SEC, the various groups of funds have\\nundertaken a worthy project. They are trying to eliminate the gobbledygook in', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='their brochures and cut down on the legalese that often goes on for many pages,\\nwhich few investors ever read. Much of this legalese is put there because the\\ngovernment requires it, but it ends up wasting time, confusing investors, and\\ncosting them money. The bill for printing all these pages is paid out of the assets\\nof the fund.\\nThe goal of this new campaign is to produce simpler and shorter explanations\\nthat people can understand without having to go to law school. The companies\\nthat run funds and the shareholders who invest in funds will both be better off if\\nthis campaign succeeds.\\nAfter the long period when the public avoided them, mutual funds came back\\ninto favor in the late 1960s, when they were sold in neighborhoods across the\\ncountry by teachers, shopkeepers, clerks, you name it, working part-time on\\nweekends and at night. This led to a poor result, because millions of investors\\ngot into funds just in time for the bear market of 1969–73, the worst since the\\nCrash of 1929.\\nIn this extended losing streak for stocks, the prices of some mutual funds\\ndropped 75 percent—more proof that there’s no safety in numbers when it\\ncomes to owning shares in a fund. Stunned by their losses, distraught investors\\nmade a mad dash for the exits, selling their shares for far less than they had paid,\\ndepositing the proceeds in savings accounts, and promising themselves to hang\\nup the phone the next time they got a call from a fund salesman.\\nFor nearly a decade thereafter, it was hard to get anybody to invest money in\\na stock mutual fund. High-quality funds were left sitting alone as if they had bad\\nbreath. Smart fund managers could find plenty of great stocks to buy, and at\\nbargain prices, but without clients, they had no money to buy them with.\\nAs the stock market revived in the 1980s, so did the mutual fund industry. It’s\\nbeen going gangbusters ever since, with 5,655 funds and counting, and more\\nthan thirteen hundred new funds created in the past two years alone. Every other\\nday brings another fund: bond funds, money-market funds, and stock funds, to\\nadd to the more than twenty-one hundred stock funds that already exist. If this\\nhectic birthrate keeps up much longer, we’ll soon have more stock funds than\\nstocks.\\nBuying Funds Now\\nIt would take a whole book in itself to describe the different kinds of stock funds\\nthat are out there: the all-purpose funds, single-industry funds, multi-industry,', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='small-company, large-company, pure, hybrid, foreign, domestic, socially\\nconscious, socially unconscious, growth, value, income, and growth-and-income\\nfunds. It’s gotten so complicated that there are funds of funds that specialize in\\nbuying shares in other funds.\\nYou could stay up day and night studying how to choose the right fund, and\\nyou wouldn’t get through half the information that’s been printed on the subject.\\nIf all these how-to books, pamphlets, and articles fell on top of you, it would\\ntake a rescue squad several hours to pull you out. In fact, so much attention is\\ndevoted to picking the right fund in any given year, it could begin to drive\\npeople crazy. They’d be happier, more relaxed, and nicer to dogs and children,\\nplus they’d save on psychiatry bills if only they would abandon the search for\\nthe absolutely perfect mutual fund.\\nAt the risk of contributing further to the unhealthy fixation on this quest, we\\npresent the following bits of advice:\\n1. You can buy mutual funds directly from the companies that manage them,\\nsuch as Dreyfus, Fidelity, and Scudder. You can also buy them through a\\nstockbroker, although a broker may not be able to sell you the fund you want.\\n2. Brokers have to make a living, and they sometimes get a bigger\\ncommission for selling the firm’s own products. Convincing you to buy one of\\nthe in-house mutual funds may be in their best interest, but not necessarily in\\nyours. Whenever a broker recommends anything, always find out what’s in it for\\nthe broker. Ask him or her to provide information on the full range of what’s\\navailable. There might be a fund that’s similar to the one the broker is\\nrecommending but that has a better record overall.\\n3. If you’re a long-term investor, ignore all the bond funds and hybrid funds\\n(those invest in a mixture of stocks and bonds) and go for the pure stock funds.\\nStocks have outperformed bonds in eight of the nine decades in this century\\n(bonds ran a close second in the 1980s, but stocks still did slightly better). In the\\nfirst half of the 1990s, stocks once again are way ahead of bonds. If you’re not\\n100 percent invested in stocks, you’re shortchanging yourself in the long run.\\n4. Picking the right fund isn’t any easier than picking the right auto mechanic,\\nbut with a fund, at least you’ve got the record of past performance to guide you.\\nUnless you interview dozens of customers, there’s no simple way of telling\\nwhether an auto mechanic is good, bad, or indifferent, but you can find out easily\\nwhich of these ratings applies to a fund. It all boils down to the annual return. A\\nfund that returned 18 percent a year over the past decade has done better than a\\nsimilar fund with similar objectives that returned 14 percent. But before you', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='invest in a fund on the strength of its record, make sure the manager who\\ncompiled the great record is still in charge.\\n5. Over time, it’s been more profitable to invest in small companies than in\\nlarge companies. The successful small companies of today will become the Wal-\\nMarts, Home Depots, and Microsofts of tomorrow. It’s no wonder then that\\nfunds that invest in small companies (the so-called small caps) have beaten out\\nthe “large cap” funds by a substantial margin. (“Cap” is short for “market\\ncapitalization”—the total number of shares issued by a company multiplied by\\nthe current share price.) A couple of Wal-Marts is all they need to outperform\\nthe competition. That one stock is up more than two-hundred-and-fifty-fold in\\ntwenty years.\\nSince smallcap stocks are generally more volatile than large-cap stocks, a\\nsmallcap fund will give you more extreme ups and downs than other types of\\nfunds. But if you have a strong stomach and can take the bumps and stay on the\\nride, you’ll likely do better in small caps.\\n6. Why take a chance on a rookie fund, when you can invest in a veteran fund\\nthat’s been around through several seasons and has turned in an all-star\\nperformance? A list of funds that have stayed on top over many years can be\\nfound in financial magazines such as Barron’s and Forbes. Twice a year,\\nBarron’s publishes a complete roundup of funds, with the details provided by\\nLipper Analytical, a high-quality research company run by a prominent fund\\nwatcher, Michael Lipper. The Wall Street Journal publishes a similar roundup\\nfour times a year.\\nIf you want more information about a particular fund, you can get it from\\nMorningstar, a company that tracks thousands of funds and issues a monthly\\nreport. Morningstar ranks all these funds for safety, rates their performance, and\\ntells who the manager is and what stocks are in the portfolio. It’s the best one-\\nstop source in existence today.\\n7. It doesn’t pay to be a fund jumper. Some investors make a hobby of\\nswitching from one fund to another, hopping to the bandwagon of the latest hot\\nperformer. This is more trouble than it’s worth. Studies have shown that top-\\nranked funds from one year rarely repeat their performance the next. Trying to\\ncatch the winner is a fool’s errand in which you are likely to end up with a loser.\\nYou’re better off picking a fund with an excellent long-term record and sticking\\nwith it.\\n8. In addition to taking the annual expenses out of the shareholders’ assets,\\nsome funds charge an entry fee, called a load. These days, the average load is 3', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='to 4 percent. That means whenever you invest in a fund with a load, you lose 3 to\\n4 percent of your money right off the bat.\\nFor all the funds that charge an entry fee, there are just as many that don’t.\\nThese are the no-loads. As it turns out, the no-loads perform just as well, on\\naverage, as the funds with loads. This is one case where paying a cover charge\\ndoesn’t necessarily get you into a classier joint.\\nThe longer you stay in a fund, the less important the load becomes. After ten\\nor fifteen years, if the fund does well, you’ll forget you ever paid the 3 or 4\\npercent load to get into it.\\nThe annual expenses deserve closer attention than the load, because those are\\ntaken out of the fund every year. Funds that keep their expenses to a minimum\\n(less than 1 percent) have a built-in advantage over funds that run a bigger tab (2\\npercent or more). The manager of a high-cost fund is working at a disadvantage.\\nEvery year, he or she has to outperform the manager of a low-cost fund by 0.5 to\\n1.5 percent to produce the same results.\\n9. The vast majority of funds employ managers whose goal it is to beat the so-\\ncalled market averages. That’s why you’re paying these managers—to pick\\nstocks that do better than the average stock. But fund managers often fail to beat\\nthe averages—in some years more than half the funds do worse. One of the\\nreasons they do worse is that fees and expenses are subtracted from a fund’s\\nperformance.\\nSome investors have given up trying to pick a fund that beats the averages,\\nwhich has proven to be a difficult task. Instead, they choose a fund that is\\nguaranteed to match the average, no matter what. This kind of fund is called an\\nindex fund. It doesn’t need a manager. It runs on automatic pilot. It simply buys\\nall the stocks in a particular index and holds on to them.\\nThere is no fuss, no experts to pay, no management fees to speak of, no\\ncommissions for getting into and out of different stocks, and no decisions to\\nmake. For instance, an S&P 500 Index fund buys all five hundred stocks in the\\nStandard & Poor’s 500 stock index. This S&P 500 Index is a well-known market\\naverage, so when you invest in such a fund, you’ll always get an average result,\\nwhich based on recent performance will be a better result than you’d get in many\\nof the managed funds.\\nOr, if you decide to invest in a “small cap” fund to take advantage of the big\\npotential payoffs from small companies, you can buy a fund that tracks a small-\\nstock index, such as the Russell 2,000. That way, your money will be spread out\\namong the two thousand stocks in the Russell Index.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='Another possibility is to put some of your money into an S&P 500 Index fund\\nto get the gains from the larger companies, and the rest in a small-stock index\\nfund to get the gains from the smaller companies. That way, you’ll never have to\\nread another article about how to pick a winning mutual fund, and you’ll end up\\ndoing better than some of the people who study the situation very carefully, and\\nthen put themselves into funds that fail to beat the averages.\\nPicking Your Own Stocks\\nIf you have the time and the inclination, you can embark on a thrilling lifetime\\nadventure: picking your own stocks. This is a lot more work than investing in a\\nmutual fund, but you can derive a great deal of satisfaction from picking your\\nown stocks. Over time, perhaps you’ll do better than most of the funds.\\nNot all your stocks will go up—no stockpicker in history has ever had a 100\\npercent success rate. Warren Buffett has made mistakes, and Peter Lynch could\\nfill several notebooks with the stories of his. But a few big winners a decade is\\nall you need. If you own ten stocks, and three of them are big winners, they will\\nmore than make up for the one or two losers and the six or seven stocks that have\\ndone just OK.\\nIf you can manage to find a few triples in your lifetime—stocks that have\\nincreased threefold over what you paid for them—you’ll never lack for spending\\nmoney, no matter how many losers you pick along the way. And once you get\\nthe hang of how to follow a company’s progress, you can put more money into\\nthe successful companies and reduce your stake in the flops.\\nYou may not triple your money in a stock very often, but you only need a few\\ntriples in a lifetime to build up a sizeable fortune. Here’s the math: if you start\\nout with $10,000 and manage to triple it five times, you’ve got $2.4 million, and\\nif you triple it ten times, you’ve got $590 million, and 13 times, you’re the\\nrichest person in America.\\nActually, there’s nothing to keep you from investing in mutual funds and\\nbuying your own stocks as well. Many investors do both. Much of the advice in\\nthe mutual fund section—the advantages of starting early, of having a plan, of\\nsticking to the plan and not worrying about crashes and corrections—also applies\\nto the portfolio of stocks you pick on your own. Two problems confront you\\nright away: How do I figure out which stocks to pick? Where do I get the money\\nto buy them? Since it’s dangerous to put money into stocks before you figure out\\nhow to pick them, you should put yourself through some practice drills before', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='you risk your cash.\\nYou’d be surprised how many people lose money by investing in stocks\\nbefore they know the first thing about them! It happens all the time. A person\\ngoes through life with no experience in investing, then suddenly receives a lump-\\nsum retirement benefit and throws it all into the stock market, blind, when he or\\nshe can’t tell a dividend from a divot. There ought to be some formal training for\\nthis, the way they have drivers’ ed in school. We don’t put people on the\\nhighway without giving them a few lessons in the parking lot and teaching them\\nthe rules of the road.\\nIf nobody else is going to train you, at least you can put yourself through\\ntraining, trying out various strategies on paper, to begin to get a feel for the way\\ndifferent kinds of stock behave. Again, a young person has an advantage. You\\nhave the luxury of experimenting with imaginary investments, at least for a\\nwhile, because you have many decades ahead of you. By the time you have the\\nmoney to invest, you’ll be fully prepared to do it for real.\\nYou’ve heard of fantasy baseball, where you pick an imaginary team from the\\nmajor-league rosters to see how your team’s batting average, home run\\nproduction, and so forth, measure up against the real teams, or against other\\nfantasy teams? You can train for stocks with a fantasy portfolio. Take an\\nimaginary bankroll—$100,000, perhaps, or $1 million if you’re a big spender—\\nand use it to buy shares in your favorite companies. If, for instance, your five\\nfavorite companies are Disney, Nike, Microsoft, Ben & Jerry’s, and Pepsi, you\\ncan split $100,000 five ways and invest a mythical $20,000 in each. Choosing\\nApril 21, 1995, as your starting date, your fantasy investment lineup looks like\\nthis:\\nStock Prices 4/21/95 Number of Shares You Get for\\n$20,000 (Rounded Off to\\nNearest Share)\\nDisney 543/4 365\\nNike 731/8 274\\nPepsi 411/4 485\\nBen & Jerry’s 125/8 1,584\\nMicrosoft 75 267\\nOnce you’ve chosen your stocks and written down the prices, you can', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='track your gains and losses just as you would if you’d put in hard cash.\\nYou can compare your results to the results your parents are getting in their\\nreal investments (if they have any), or to the results of various mutual funds,\\nor to other mythical portfolios your friends have made up.\\nSchools across the country have brought fantasy stockpicking into the\\nclassroom, with The Stock Market Game, sponsored and distributed by The\\nSecurities Industry Foundation for Economic Education. More than 600,000\\nstudents played the game during the 1994/1995 school year.\\nThey divide into teams, and each team has to decide which stocks to buy with\\nits mythical bankroll. The game takes about ten weeks from start to finish.\\nResults are tallied, and the team whose stocks have gone up the most at the end\\nof the period wins the game. The winning teams in each school compete with the\\nwinners from other schools in local, county, and regional or state competitions.\\nPlaying The Stock Market Game can be fun as well as educational, as long as\\nthe players are taught the basics of investing and don’t take the results too\\nseriously. The problem with this sort of training is that over thirteen weeks,\\ntwenty-six weeks, or even a year, what happens to stock prices is largely a\\nmatter of luck. The practice sessions don’t last long enough to give you a true\\ntest. A stock can be a loser in thirteen weeks, but a big winner in three years, or\\nfive years. Or it can be a winner in thirteen weeks but a loser down the road.\\nStocks that do well in the long run belong to companies that do well in the\\nlong run. The key to successful investing is finding successful companies. To get\\nthe most out of your training sessions, you have to do more than follow the\\nprices of the stocks. You have to learn as much as possible about the companies\\nyou’ve chosen and what makes them tick.\\nThis brings us to the five basic methods people use to pick a stock. Here’s the\\nrundown on each, beginning with the most ridiculous and ending with the most\\nenlightened.\\n1. Darts. The lowest form of stockpicking. You throw a dart at the stock page\\nand wherever it lands, you buy that stock. Or you close your eyes and use your\\nfinger as the dart. Maybe you’ll get lucky and your finger will hit on a stock that\\ndoes well—but maybe you won’t.\\nThe best thing you can say about the dart method is that it doesn’t take much\\nwork. If you’re inclined to pick stocks at random, you’ll be doing yourself a\\nfavor by avoiding the whole business and investing in mutual funds.\\n2. Hot tips. The second-lowest form of stockpicking, where somebody else\\ntells you to buy a stock that’s a cinch to go up. It could be your best friend, your', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='English teacher, your uncle Harry, the plumber, the auto mechanic, or the\\ngardener. Or maybe you overhear the tip on a bus. For some reason, overhearing\\na tip gets people more excited than if the tip was meant for them.\\nIt’s possible that Uncle Harry is directly involved with a certain company and\\nknows what he’s talking about. That sort of informed tip can be useful—a clue\\nthat’s worth investigating further. But the dangerous kind of hot tip is based on\\nnothing but hot air. Here’s a typical example: “Home Shopping Network. The\\nsmart money is accumulating this stock. Buy right away, before it’s too late. It\\nlooks like that sucker’s going up.”\\nPeople who won’t buy a fifty-dollar toaster oven without checking several\\nstores for the best price will throw thousands of dollars at a hot tip such as\\n“Home Shopping Network.” They do this because they can’t stand to miss out\\non all the profit they’ll “lose” if they ignore the tip and the Home Shopping stock\\nquadruples. The truth is, if they don’t buy Home Shopping and it quadruples,\\nthey haven’t lost a penny.\\nPeople never lose money on stocks they don’t own. They only lose money if\\nthey buy Home Shopping and it goes down and they sell it for less than they paid\\nfor it.\\n3. Educated tips. You get these from experts who appear on TV or are quoted\\nin newspapers and magazines. There’s a constant stream of educated tips\\nflowing out of fund managers, investment advisors, and other Wall Street gurus.\\nYou’re not the only person who’s been let in on these educated tips. Millions of\\nreaders and listeners are hearing the same thing you are.\\nNevertheless, if you can’t resist acting on a tip, you might as well take a tip\\nfrom an expert and ignore Uncle Harry’s tip. There’s a decent chance the expert\\nhas done enough homework to form an educated opinion, whereas Uncle Harry\\ndoesn’t know what he’s talking about, beyond “It looks like that sucker’s going\\nup.”\\nThe problem with expert tips is that when the expert changes his mind, you\\nhave no way of finding that out—unless he goes back on TV to inform the\\nviewers and you happen to catch the show. Otherwise, you’ll be holding on to\\nthe stock because you think the expert likes it, long after he’s stopped liking it.\\n4. The broker’s buy list. Stockbrokers of the “full-service” variety are never\\nshy about giving their recommendations on what stocks you should buy. Often,\\nthese recommendations do not come from the broker’s own head. They come\\nfrom the analysts who work behind the scenes at the head office, usually in New\\nYork. These are well-trained Sherlocks whose job it is to snoop into the affairs', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='of companies or groups of companies. They issue buy signals and sell signals\\nbased on the evidence they dredge up.\\nThe brokerage firm collects the buy signals from its analysts and puts them on\\na buy list, which is sent out to all the brokers, including yours—if you have a\\nbroker. Usually, the buy list is divided into categories: stocks for conservative\\ninvestors, stocks for aggressive investors, stocks that pay dividends, and so forth.\\nYou can build an excellent portfolio by working with a broker to pick stocks\\nfrom the buy list. That way, you can rely on the brokerage firm’s research and\\nstill get to choose which of the “buys” you like best. This has one big advantage\\nover relying on educated tips. If the brokerage firm changes its mind and moves\\none of your stocks from the buy list to the sell list, your broker will inform you\\nof the fact. If he doesn’t, then put the broker on your sell list.\\n5. Doing your own research. This is the highest form of stockpicking. You\\nchoose the stock because you like the company, and you like the company\\nbecause you’ve studied it inside and out. Maybe you already did that with your\\nfive favorite companies in your fantasy portfolio, as in the example of Disney,\\nNike, Ben & Jerry’s, Pepsi, and Microsoft shown on page 127.\\nThe more you learn about investing in companies, the less you have to rely on\\nother people’s opinions, and the better you can evaluate other people’s tips. You\\ncan decide for yourself what stocks to buy and when to buy them.\\nYou’ll need two kinds of information: the kind you get by keeping your eyes\\npeeled and the kind you get by studying the numbers. The first kind, you can\\nbegin to gather every time you walk into a McDonald’s, a Sunglass Hut\\nInternational, or any other store that’s owned by a publicly traded company. And\\nif you work in the store, so much the better.\\nYou can see for yourself whether the operation is efficient or sloppy,\\noverstaffed or understaffed, well-organized or chaotic. You can gauge the\\nmorale of your fellow employees. You get a sense of whether management is\\nreckless or careful with money.\\nIf you’re out front with the customers, you can size up the crowd. Are they\\nlining up at the cash register, or does the place look empty? Are they happy with\\nthe merchandise, or do they complain a lot? These little details can tell you a\\ngreat deal about the quality of the parent company itself. Have you ever seen a\\nmessy Gap or an empty McDonald’s? The employees at any of the Gap outlets\\nor the McDonald’s franchises could have noticed long ago how fantastically\\nsuccessful these operations have been and invested their spare cash accordingly.\\nA store doesn’t have to fall apart to lose customers. It will lose customers', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='when another store comes along that offers better merchandise and better\\nservice, for the same prices or lower prices. Employees are among the first to\\nknow when a competitor is luring the clients away. There’s nothing to stop them\\nfrom investing in the competitor.\\nEven if you don’t have a job in a publicly traded company, you can see\\nwhat’s going on from the customer angle. Every time you shop in a store, eat a\\nhamburger, or buy new sunglasses, you’re getting valuable input. By browsing\\naround, you can see what’s selling and what isn’t. By watching your friends, you\\nknow which computers they’re buying, which brand of soda they’re drinking,\\nwhich movies they’re watching, whether Reeboks are in or out. These are all\\nimportant clues that can lead you to the right stocks.\\nYou’d be surprised how many adults fail to follow up on such clues. Millions\\nof people work in industries where they come in daily contact with potential\\ninvestments and never take advantage of their front-row seat. Doctors know\\nwhich drug companies make the best drugs, but they don’t always buy the drug\\nstocks. Bankers know which banks are the strongest and have the lowest\\nexpenses and make the smartest loans, but they don’t necessarily buy the bank\\nstocks. Store managers and the people who run malls have access to the monthly\\nsales figures, so they know for sure which retailers are selling the most\\nmerchandise. But how many mall managers have enriched themselves by\\ninvesting in specialty retail stocks?\\nOnce you start looking at the world through a stockpicker’s eyes, where\\neverything is a potential investment, you begin to notice the companies that do\\nbusiness with the companies that got your attention in the first place. If you work\\nin a hospital, you come into contact with companies that make sutures, surgical\\ngowns, syringes, beds and bed pans, X-ray equipment, EKG machines;\\ncompanies that help the hospital keep its costs down; companies that write the\\nhealth insurance; companies that handle the billing. The grocery store is another\\nhotbed of companies: dozens of them are represented in each aisle.\\nYou also begin to notice when a competitor is doing a better job than the\\ncompany that hired you. When people were lining up to buy Chrysler minivans,\\nit wasn’t just the Chrysler salesmen who realized Chrysler was on its way to\\nmaking record profits. It was also the Buick salesmen down the block, who sat\\naround their empty showroom and realized that a lot of Buick customers must\\nhave switched to Chrysler.\\nThis brings us to the numbers. That a company makes a popular product\\ndoesn’t mean you should automatically buy the stock. There’s a lot more you', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='have to know before you invest. You have to know if the company is spending\\nits cash wisely or frittering it away. You have to know how much it owes to the\\nbanks. You have to know if the sales are growing, and how fast. You have to\\nknow how much money it earned in past years, and how much it can expect to\\nearn in the future. You have to know if the stock is selling at a fair price, a\\nbargain price, or too high a price.\\nYou have to know if the company is paying a dividend, and if so, how much\\nof a dividend, and how often it is raised. Earnings, sales, debt, dividends, the\\nprice of the stock: These are some of the key numbers stockpickers must follow.\\nPeople go to graduate school to learn how to read and interpret these\\nnumbers, so this is not a subject that can be covered in depth in a primer such as\\nthis one. The best we can do is to give you a glimpse at the basic elements of a\\ncompany’s finances, so you can begin to see how the numbers fit together.\\nYou’ll find this information in Appendix Two: Reading the Numbers—How to\\nDecipher a Balance Sheet, on page 251.\\nNo investor can possibly hope to keep up with the more than thirteen\\nthousand companies whose stocks are traded on the major exchanges in the U.S.\\nmarkets today. That’s why amateurs and pros alike are forced to cut down on\\ntheir options by specializing in one kind of company or another. For instance,\\nsome investors buy stocks only in companies that have a habit of raising their\\ndividends. Others look for companies whose earnings are growing by at least 20\\npercent a year.\\nYou can specialize in a certain industry, such as electric utilities or restaurants\\nor banks. You can specialize in small companies or large companies, new\\ncompanies or old ones. You can specialize in companies that have fallen on hard\\ntimes and are trying to make a comeback. (These are called “turnarounds.”)\\nThere are hundreds of different ways to skin this cat.\\nInvesting is not an exact science, and no matter how hard you study the\\nnumbers and how much you learn about a company’s past performance, you can\\nnever be sure about its future performance. What will happen tomorrow is\\nalways a guess. Your job as an investor is to make educated guesses and not\\nblind ones. Your job is to pick stocks and not pay too much for them, then to\\nkeep watching for good news or bad news coming out of the companies you\\nown. You can use your knowledge to keep the risks to a minimum.\\nOwning Stocks for Real', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='You can play stock-market games from morning till night, but there’s no\\nsubstitute for the thrill of owning real shares. People remember their first shares\\nthe way they remember their first kiss. No matter how many dozens of\\ncompanies you’ll own in the future, you never get over the first.\\nAt this point, if anything is holding you back, it has to be money. Young\\npeople have the time to invest, but they don’t always have the cash. It’s not just\\nany cash that can safely be put into stocks; it’s cash you can afford to live\\nwithout for many years while it goes forth and multiplies. If you have a part-time\\njob and can afford to invest a portion of your paycheck, so much the better. If\\nnot, perhaps you can drop some hints to family members around the holidays.\\nHere’s where parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles can play a leading role.\\nThe greatest source of investment capital for young people is relatives. When\\nthey ask what you want for your birthday, Christmas, Hanukkah, and so forth,\\ntell them you want stocks. Let them know that if it comes down to a choice\\nbetween owning a new pair of Nikes or owning a share of Nike, which costs\\nabout the same amount as the shoes, you’d rather have the share.\\nThis is guaranteed to impress most adults. They’ll be amazed by your\\nforesight and your maturity, and your ratings will soar in the family popularity\\npolls. If they own shares themselves, they can get you started by simply\\ntransferring one share, or many shares, over to you. The paperwork is no\\nproblem, and they don’t have to pay a fee or a commission to do this. Thousands\\nof young people in each generation are introduced to investing in this fashion, by\\nolder people giving them their first stocks. A steady stream of shares trickles\\ndown from grandparents to their grandchildren.\\nMany grandparents have gotten into the habit of giving savings bonds instead\\nof stocks. If you have grandparents of this type, it’s in your best interest to show\\nthem the chart on page 110, so they realize how much better off you’d be if they\\ndispensed with the savings bonds and sent you shares of good companies at\\nevery opportunity.\\nWhile small numbers of shares are routinely handed down from parents or\\ngrandparents, it’s been difficult for young people to buy small numbers of shares\\non their own. Until recently, in fact, young investors have been discouraged from\\nbuying the one share or few shares that would get them started investing. Two\\nbarriers stand in the way: First, most stock transactions are handled by brokers,\\nand you can’t open your own brokerage account until you’re twenty-one years\\nold, and second, most brokers charge minimum commissions, which range from\\n$25 to $40. If you’re buying one share of Pepsi for $47 and you have to pay the', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='broker a $40 fee, the commission is almost as expensive as the share. No\\nsuccessful investor can afford to pay $87 for a $47 stock.\\nThis sad state of affairs is changing, as companies have begun to sell small\\nquantities of their own shares directly to the public, bypassing the brokers. After\\nall, if McDonald’s can sell you a hamburger, why shouldn’t it be allowed to sell\\nyou its stock?\\nAlready eighty companies have adopted a so-called direct investment\\nprogram in which individuals can purchase a few shares and pay significantly\\nlower commissions than the deepest discount broker, and in some cases, pay\\nnothing at all. It’s the best thing Wall Street has done for young people since the\\nNew York Stock Exchange invited the Beatles onto the floor in the 1960s.\\nAccording to Jim Volpe, a vice-president at the First Chicago Trust Company\\nand a spearhead of the direct investment campaign, at least 850 more companies\\nhave said they would be delighted to join the eighty that already are selling the\\nshares directly to the public and the list is growing.

The legal wrinkles are being ironed out.\\nYou probably won’t be able to buy just one share via direct investment,\\nbecause most companies are requiring a minimum purchase of $250 to $1,000.\\nDepending on which company you want to own, you’ll have to save up your\\nmoney until you’ve got the $250 or whatever it takes, but that’s a minor\\ndrawback compared to the benefit of paying a significantly lower commission.\\nThe best part is, once you’ve made your initial purchase, you can continue to\\nbuy shares directly from the company, whenever you want, and without paying a\\npenny in commissions. And whenever the company pays a dividend, yours is\\nautomatically converted into more shares through the dividend reinvestment\\nplan. In most cases, you’re dealing directly with the company’s transfer agent,\\nwithout having to get involved with a stockbroker.\\nKeep an eye out for the news of this exciting new program, which will help\\nput stocks into the hands of millions of investors who’ve been shut out of the\\nmarket.\\nIf you’re still attached to the idea of buying one share at a time, there’s a\\nprogram that allows you to do it. But first your family has to join the National\\nAssociation of Investors Corporation (NAIC). The NAIC is the support group\\nfor hundreds of investment clubs around the country. The address is 711 West\\nThirteen Mile Road, Madison Heights, MI, 48071, and the phone number is 1-\\n810-583-6242.\\nAs of January 1996 a membership costs thirty-five dollars a year. Individual', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='club members or households pay fourteen dollars a year, which gives them an\\nautomatic subscription to a monthly magazine called Better Investing with all\\nkinds of useful information that will help you become a better stockpicker. Most\\nof this material is geared to experienced investors, but some of it is for\\nbeginners, and you can learn a lot from it. Aside from the magazine, you get the\\nchance to buy one to ten shares in any one of 151 different companies, and you\\nonly have to pay a seven-dollar setup fee per transaction.\\nThe buy-a-share program is designed for kids, although once again, you’ll run\\ninto the “age of majority” problem. Depending on the laws in the state where\\nyou live, you have to be eighteen or twenty-one to make the purchase on your\\nown. Otherwise, a parent or guardian can act on your behalf—you’re going to\\nneed one or the other to sign up for the club membership, anyway.\\nThe program works as follows. The NAIC provides you with the names of all\\n151 companies in which you can buy stock. You figure out which ones you want\\nto purchase, and you look up the price per share of each. Then you send your\\nbuy list to the NAIC, along with a check for the current price of each stock\\nyou’re buying, plus the seven-dollar fee per company, plus an extra $10\\n“fluctuation.” For instance, if the current price of McDonald’s is $40, you send\\n$57.\\nWhy the extra $10? If the stock price goes up between the day you send in\\nyour letter and the day your order is processed, the reserve will be used to cover\\nthe difference. In any event, the $10 won’t be wasted. Whatever is left of it after\\nyou buy your first share will be used to buy a fraction of another share. So you’ll\\nend up with a share and a sixteenth, or a share and an eighth, or a share and a\\nquarter.\\nAt this point, the NAIC drops out of the relationship, and you deal directly\\nwith a representative (the transfer agent) of Wendy’s, or McDonald’s, or\\nwhatever company you just bought a share in. Since all the companies on the\\nNAIC list have dividend reinvestment programs, you’ll get additional fractions\\nof shares whenever the company pays a dividend. You can also buy more shares\\nwhenever you want, paying a nominal fee, if any.\\nIf you decide to sell your shares, you can either take them to a stockbroker\\n(again, the high commissions might cause you to reject this option) or notify the\\ncompany’s agent (or agents) in writing. They will dispose of the shares on the\\nnext date they’ve scheduled for buying and selling, at whatever the price\\nhappens to be at that time. You won’t know exactly what price you’ll get until\\nafter the shares are sold.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='As long as you’ve gone to the trouble of joining the NAIC, there’s nothing to\\nstop you from joining one of its investment clubs. There are NAIC-member\\nclubs in cities, towns, villages, and schools across the country. Even some\\nprisons have them.\\nBeing in an investment club is like being on a team in the Stock Market\\nGame. The difference is, if you’re in a club, you’re investing real money. Most\\nclubs meet once a month in a member’s house—where the group hashes out the\\nlatest stockpicking ideas. Stocks are bought and sold on majority vote.\\nEach member agrees to invest a fixed amount every month. It could be fifty\\ndollars, or one hundred dollars—whatever the majority decides. As it turns out,\\nmost people do better investing in a club than they do on their own. That’s\\nbecause the club gives them built-in discipline. They can’t sell stocks in a panic,\\nbecause cooler heads in the group will vote them down. They can’t buy stocks\\nwithout convincing the group that the stocks are worth buying. This forces them\\nto do their homework. If somebody says, “I’m recommending Disney because I\\nheard a hot tip in the cafeteria line,” he’ll be laughed out of the room.\\nTo become a voting member of an investment club, you have to be at least\\neighteen, as we’ve already mentioned. But even if you’re not eighteen, you can\\ntake part in meetings, recommend stocks, and add your opinion to every\\ndiscussion. If a club member who’s past the legal investing age is willing to act\\nas your custodian, you can invest your own money through a custodial account.\\nBuying Shares on the Stock Exchange\\nIf somebody asked you to name five institutions the country couldn’t live\\nwithout for a month or two, what would you say? The military? The police?\\nCongress? The courts? Electric companies? The water department? Hospitals?\\nClose your eyes for a minute and make your five choices, without looking at the\\nnext paragraph.\\nDid you include the stock market or the bond market in your list? Most\\npeople wouldn’t. Wall Street doesn’t immediately come to mind when we think\\nabout essential services that give us food, gas, lodging, and a dial tone, and keep\\nthe robbers from the door. But the truth is that the financial markets are very\\nimportant to the well-being of the entire population, and not just the owners of\\nbonds and stocks. The White House could give itself a month off and the world\\nwould go on, but without a stock market or a bond market, our whole economic\\nsystem would seize up.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='A company or a person that needed to sell stocks to raise cash would be out of\\nluck, because without a market, there’d be no buyers. The government, $5\\ntrillion in the red already, would have no way to sell bonds to cover its expenses,\\nthe way it normally does. It would be left with two choices, both bad. It could\\nprint tons of fresh cash, cheapening the value of the dollar and sending prices\\nthrough the roof, or it could stop paying its bills, leaving millions of Americans\\nwithout their main source of income. Companies would go bankrupt and banks\\nwould go bankrupt. Mobs of people would rush to the nearest branches to rescue\\ntheir money, only to discover that the banks had run out. Stores would close,\\nfactories would close, and millions of people would be thrown out of work.\\nYou’d see them wandering the streets, searching the Dumpsters for half-eaten\\npizzas. Civilization as we know it would come to a quick end, and all because\\nthe markets shut down. So these markets are much more important than we give\\nthem credit for. We couldn’t survive for long without them.\\nThe Role of the Broker\\nLet’s say you have the resources to buy enough shares so it makes sense to go\\nthe regular route—through a broker. If you’re serious about investing, eventually\\nyou will reach this point. The broker is your conduit into the stock markets on\\nwhich the fate of the world now depends.\\nSince there’s no way you can walk into a stock market and buy and sell\\nshares on your own, you have to work through a broker at a brokerage house.\\nYou’ve heard the names: Merrill Lynch, Smith Barney, Dean Witter, Paine\\nWebber, Charles Schwab, and so forth. Schwab is a living person, and Witter a\\ndeceased one, but the rest of these names are composites. There was a Mr.\\nMerrill and a Mr. Lynch, a Mr. Smith and a Mr. Barney, a Mr. Paine and a Mr.\\nWebber, and so forth.\\nBrokerage houses such as these try to convey the impression they go back\\nvery far in history and are quite stable, when in fact they’re always merging and\\nchanging their names. It’s a very volatile business with many marriages of\\nconvenience, and casualties along the way.\\nAll major brokerage houses handle stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, and they\\nall have to abide by the same rules laid down by the government. But beyond\\nthat, they are quite different. The so-called full-service brokers, such as Merrill\\nLynch or Smith Barney, charge higher commissions than the “discount brokers,”\\nsuch as Schwab. Then there are the “deep-discount brokers,” that offer fewer', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='services.\\nThe extra money you pay a full-service broker entitles you to the brokerage\\nfirm’s advice. As a rule, discount brokers don’t offer advice. They just buy and\\nsell on your instructions.\\nHere you have another decision to make. Along with picking your first stock,\\nyou have to pick a broker. The best way to do this is to talk to several in your\\narea—especially brokers who are recommended by your friends or relatives. If\\nyou don’t like the first one you meet, there are plenty of others around. Some are\\nvery experienced and know a great deal about investing in stocks, while others\\nhave just come out of a short training course and know very little. Having a good\\nrelationship with a broker is part of the fun of investing.\\nOnce you’ve settled on the brokerage house and the broker, the next step is\\nopening an account. This brings us to another snag: Unless you’re twenty-one,\\nyou can’t have your own account. In most states, the investing age is the same as\\nthe drinking age. You can drive a car at sixteen, and join the Army at sixteen, but\\nyou’re not allowed to do business with a broker until you’ve reached the “age of\\nmajority.”\\nYou can get around this “age of majority” problem by setting up an account\\nwith a parent or a guardian who can act as “custodian.” This is like having a\\nrestricted driver’s license, where you control the vehicle but there’s an adult in\\nthe passenger’s seat to cheer you on, or to yell when you veer off course.\\nLet’s say you’ve opened the custodial account, signed the necessary papers,\\ngiven the broker whatever amount of money you intend to invest, and told the\\nbroker you’re interested in Disney. A good full-service broker will punch up\\nDisney on the special computer that brokers have and read you the recent news\\nabout the company.\\nHe or she will also give you the research reports on Disney prepared by the\\nin-house expert, or analyst, who keeps tabs on the company. If they do their job\\nright, analysts can be very valuable sources of information.\\nIt’s possible that the analyst doesn’t like Disney at the moment, or thinks it’s\\noverpriced, or that low attendance at the theme parks will hurt the company. It’s\\nalso possible that your broker will try to talk you out of Disney and into some\\nother stock the brokerage house likes better.\\nBut if you’ve done your homework and you still think Disney is a good buy,\\nthen you might as well stick to your guns and insist on buying it. After all, it’s\\nyour money.\\nThe next thing to consider is the price you want to pay for Disney. Again, you', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='have a choice to make. You can buy a stock “at the market,” which means you’ll\\nget whatever the price happens to be at the moment your order is sent to Wall\\nStreet. Or you can put in a “limit order” for a specific price and hope somebody\\nwill take you up on it. That’s the chance you take with limit orders: You are\\nwaiting to buy at a certain price, which you may or may not get.\\nLet’s say your broker has consulted on his computer and informed you that\\nDisney is trading at fifty dollars a share. You decide to put in your bid “at the\\nmarket.” The broker transmits your order through the computer and into the New\\nYork Stock Exchange.\\nThe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is the oldest and most prestigious\\nstock exchange in the world, located just off Wall Street at 82 Broad Street, in a\\nfancy building with Greek columns in front that reminds you of a courthouse or\\na post office. There are other stock exchanges, but the NYSE is where Disney is\\n“listed”—meaning that shares of Disney are always on sale there.\\nIf you’re in New York sometime and you’ve got nothing better to do, the\\nNYSE is worth a visit. The tour begins in a room full of photos and display\\nboxes where you can push buttons and learn the story of how the stock market\\ngot started under a tree in 1790. You’ll hear about how the pioneer speculators\\nand horse traders stood under this tree in the open air, buying and selling horses,\\nwheat, sugar, you name it, in a noisy, nonstop auction. After the Revolutionary\\nWar was won by our side, these traders got the chance to auction off the IOUs\\nissued by the government to pay for the war. This so-called scrip was the first\\nfinancial commodity ever sold in a marketplace in the United States.\\nLong before that, a wall was built along Wall Street to keep invaders out,\\nwhich is how the street got its name. The traders under the tree were a hardy\\nbunch, but after a while they got tired of standing out in the rain and snow, so\\nthey moved indoors to the local coffeehouses, where at least they had a roof over\\ntheir heads. As business picked up, they rented space in nearby basements and\\nlofts until they found a long-term rental and stayed there. In 1864, they built the\\nbuilding that’s been the home of the NYSE ever since. It’s no more than a\\nFrisbee toss from the spot where the original tree once stood.\\nAfter you’ve walked past the photos and the displays, and you’ve listened to a\\nshort spiel from a tour guide, you can head for the visitors’ gallery, which is the\\nmost interesting part. You’re looking down through a giant picture window, with\\na bird’s-eye view of the trading floor one hundred feet below, where all the\\naction takes place. The trading floor looks as long as a football field, and just as\\nhectic and noisy as a stadium on game day.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='The players on the stock exchange are dressed in sneakers and multicolored\\nlab coats, which are their uniforms. Hundreds of them are scurrying around,\\nwaving their arms and shouting to get one another’s attention, and the ones that\\naren’t scurrying are standing in huddles at different spots on the floor, called\\nposts. At each post, there’s an overhead TV set, hung from a maze of girders and\\npipes that looks like exposed plumbing. It’s around these monitors underneath\\nthe exposed plumbing that the shares of more than twenty-five hundred different\\ncompanies are being bought and sold while you watch.\\nYou can see the Disney post from your perch in the visitors’ gallery, and if\\nyou took the elevator downstairs and managed to sneak past the security guards,\\nyou could be on the trading floor in no time, wading into the crowd to purchase a\\nshare of Disney in person. But it doesn’t work that way. Your order has to come\\nin through the brokerage house to the traders in the lab coats. They do the actual\\nbuying and selling, sometimes for themselves, but mostly for customers like you,\\nwho have sent in their orders from all over the world.\\nThe basic routine at the post hasn’t changed for decades. The best way to\\nthink of it is as a nonstop auction where the same item is continuously brought\\nup for sale. In this case, the item is Disney stock.\\nLet’s say a trader at the Disney post yells out “1,000 at $497/ 8.” That means\\none of his customers wants to sell 1,000 shares of Disney for $497/\\n8\\napiece. If\\nanother trader at the post has a customer who wants to buy 1,000 shares at\\n$497/ 8, the two traders make a deal. But it doesn’t always happen that way. It\\nmay be that nobody wants to pay that price at that particular moment. So the\\ntrader who’s selling the Disney has to lower the price to $493/\\n4\\nor perhaps to\\n$491/ 2, until he can attract a buyer.\\nOr it may be that there are buyers at $497/ 8, but nobody wants to sell at that\\nprice. In that case, the buyers have to raise their bids to $50 or $501/ 8, and so\\nforth, until the bid gets high enough to attract a seller.\\nIt goes on like this from 9:30 A.M. when the market opens to 4:00 P.M. when it\\ncloses, the prices of shares bobbing up and down from one minute to the next as\\nthe auction continues. A person called the “specialist” stands at the post in the\\nmiddle of this commotion, listening to the bids and the offers, watching for the\\nsignals, matching the buyers with the sellers and keeping track of every deal.\\nAt present, more than 1 million shares of Disney are bought and sold on the\\nNYSE every day, along with 338 million plus shares of stock in the other\\ntwenty-six hundred listed companies. You may wonder how the lone Disney\\nspecialist standing at the post could possibly handle this volume of business. The', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='answer is, he can’t.\\nAlthough most investors are not aware of it, 85 percent of the orders arrive at\\nspecialists’ posts via computer. Computers are handling more transactions both\\non the stock exchanges and off the stock exchanges. The trading departments of\\nthe Wall Street investment houses use computers to make trades directly with\\nother trading departments. When you look down on the trading floor from the\\nvisitors’ gallery, you’re seeing a colorful spectacle that is fast becoming\\nobsolete.\\nWith a good computer network, you don’t need hundreds of people running\\naround wearing out their sneakers and yelling themselves hoarse. All the bidding\\nfor stocks can take place on a screen, and most of it already does.\\nThe NYSE has a special matchmaking system for small transactions such as\\nyours. Your buy order for Disney is sent directly into the NYSE computer,\\nwhere it is automatically matched with a sell order that comes in from somebody\\nelse.\\nStock transactions are entirely anonymous. Unlike the deals you make at flea\\nmarkets or garage sales, in a stock deal, you never come face-to-face with the\\nother party. Maybe it’s just as well, because then you don’t have to sit there and\\nlisten to the seller of the Disney shares telling you why he’s getting rid of them,\\nthe way you do when you buy a used car from a neighbor.\\nThere could be many reasons why the other party to the transaction is selling\\nthe stock that you’re buying. Maybe he needs the money to pay a college tuition\\nbill, or to repaint the house, or to take a vacation. Maybe he doesn’t like the\\nlatest Disney movies, and he’s not as optimistic as you are about the future of the\\ncompany. Or maybe he’s found another stock he’d rather own. But whatever his\\nmotivation for selling, it shouldn’t matter to you. If you’ve done your\\nhomework, you know why you’re buying.\\nAfter the computer has made a match between you and a seller, the news of\\nthe sale will move across the electronic tickertape that runs across the bottom of\\nyour TV screen on the financial networks. Have you ever watched that\\ncontinuous string of numbers? Every one is the record of an actual stock deal.\\nFor instance, “DIS 50, $50,” means that 50 shares of Disney have just been sold\\nat $50 apiece. So if you bought 50 shares at $50, the world would know about it,\\nbecause your little “DIS 50, $50” would flash across on the TV screens and\\nelectronic display monitors in brokerage houses and investment companies from\\nBoston to Beijing.\\nAndy Warhol, the famous painter of the Campbell’s Soup can (another great', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='public company!), once said that with all the media around us, every person\\nwould be famous for fifteen minutes. Warhol was only joking, but every stock\\ntrade of fifty shares or more gets its five seconds of international fame.\\nOther Places Stocks Are Traded\\nA hundred years ago, there were many stock exchanges in the United States\\nbesides the big two, the NYSE and the American. Milwaukee had one, and so\\ndid San Francisco, Philadelphia, Des Moines, and Dallas. A stock fan could\\nspend vacations riding around the country visiting the action, the way a baseball\\nfan sees games at different ballparks. But the smaller exchanges gradually lost\\ntheir importance. Most have disappeared.\\nToday’s big two are the NYSE and the NASDAQ, which is pronounced\\n“nazzdack.” NASDAQ stands for the National Association of Securities Dealers\\nAutomated Quotations System. You could stump a lot of people on this one—\\nWhat does NASDAQ stand for?—because many professionals on Wall Street\\ncouldn’t tell you. It’s a mouthful, which is why you never hear anybody use the\\nfull name.\\nIt used to be that companies that were too small to be listed on the regular\\nstock exchanges sold their shares in neighborhood stock shops, where the deals\\nwere done across a counter. A buyer in Detroit might pay 10 to 20 percent more\\nfor the same stock purchased the same day in San Antonio because there was no\\ntickertape where people could track the latest prices. The over-the-counter\\nmarket was a favorite with gamblers and wild speculators, but the average\\ninvestor was smart to stay away from it.\\nThe managers of the over-the-counter market were among the first to see how\\ncomputers could revolutionize stock trading. They realized they didn’t need a\\ngigantic trading floor like the one at the NYSE. They didn’t need a fancy\\nbuilding, or hundreds of traders in lab coats running around waving their arms.\\nAll they needed was a few computer terminals and enough people to sit in front\\nof the terminals and make the trades on their screens. Presto, NASDAQ had its\\nown electronic trading floor. Technically, it’s not an exchange. It’s a computer\\nnetwork.\\nWhen you want to buy shares of a company that trades on NASDAQ, say\\nMicrosoft, your broker sends your order into the NASDAQ computer system,\\nwhere it shows up on the screen with all the other orders from people who want\\nto buy or sell Microsoft. The NASDAQ “market maker” sits at a terminal in his', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='or her own office, which could be anywhere in the country, and puts the\\ntransactions together.\\nWhereas a specialist at the NYSE has to stand at his post all day and may get\\ncramps in his legs, the NASDAQ market maker can work from a easy chair. And\\nwhereas the NYSE specialist plays the role of matchmaker, the NASDAQ\\nmarket maker puts himself in the middle of every stock trade. He buys the shares\\nfrom the seller and turns right around and sells those shares to the buyer, at a\\nslightly higher price. The difference is his profit, called the “spread.”\\nIn the twenty-five years since it was created, the NASDAQ system has grown\\nvery fast, and today it is the major rival of the NYSE and the second-busiest\\nstock market in the country. Many tiny and obscure companies that got their start\\non the NASDAQ exchange in the 1970s and the 1980s—Microsoft, Apple\\nComputer, MCI, Intel, and so forth—have become corporate giants that employ\\nthousands of workers, sell billions of dollars’ worth of products, and are famous\\naround the world. They still trade on NASDAQ.\\nReading the Stock Pages\\nThe day after you buy your shares of Disney, you will rush to the newspaper and\\nopen it to the business pages to find out how much it is worth. That’s what\\nshareholders do every morning. It’s their first important activity, after they’ve\\ntaken a shower, brushed their teeth, put on their clothes, and poured themselves a\\ncup of coffee.\\nOne way to tell who the investors are is by watching them read the paper.\\nInvestors don’t start with the comics, or sports, or Ann Landers, the way other\\nreaders do. They head straight for the business section, and run their finger down\\nthe columns of stocks searching for yesterday’s closing prices on the companies\\nthey own.\\nTheir mood can change in a second, depending on what they see there. Maybe\\nyou’ve observed this in your own household. You’re sitting at the breakfast table\\nand your father is scanning the stock tables (usually, it’s a father who does this,\\nalthough more and more women are taking an interest). If he gets a sour look on\\nhis face and tells you for the umpteenth time not to leave the bathroom light on\\nbecause it wastes electricity, which wastes money, you can be pretty sure he just\\nfound out his stocks went down. On the other hand, if he starts humming “Hail\\nto the Chief” and offers to increase your allowance, or says he’ll pay for the limo\\nto drive you to the prom, you can be pretty sure his stocks went up.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='During business hours, when the stock exchanges are open and shares are\\nchanging hands at a rapid rate, the prices rise and fall minute by minute. But just\\nbefore the closing bell rings at 4:00 P.M., and the trading stops, every stock has its\\nlast trade of the day. It’s the price of this last trade, called the closing price, that\\ngets quoted in the papers the next morning. That’s what investors are looking for\\nwhen they turn to the business section and scan those pages of numbers,\\narranged in lines that appear like this:\\n365-Day Yld\\nHigh-Low Stock Div % P/E Sales High Low Last Chg\\n627/8 DISNEY .36 0.625 23 11090 573/4 563/4 575/8 +1/4\\n373/4\\nA lot of information is packed into this tiny space. The name of the\\nstock, DISNEY, appears in the second column from the left, under “Stock.”\\nIn the first column, “365-Day High-Low,” you see two numbers, 627/8 and\\n373/4. These represent dollars, $627/8 and $373/4. What you find out\\nhere is that $627/8 is the highest price anybody has paid for a share of\\nDisney in the last twelve months, and $373/4 is the lowest price. So\\nthere’s a wide range of prices that people will pay for the same stock.\\nIn fact, the average stock on the New York Stock Exchange moves up and\\ndown approximately 57 percent from its base price in any given year. More\\nincredible than that, one in every three stocks traded on the NYSE moves up and\\ndown 50 to 100 percent from the base price each year, and about 8 percent of the\\nstocks rise and fall 100 percent or more. A stock might start out the year selling\\nfor $12, rise to $16 during an optimistic stretch, and fall to $8 during a\\npessimistic stretch. That’s a 100 percent move: from $16 to $8. Clearly, some\\ninvestors pay a lot less than others for the same company in the same year.\\nYou’ll also notice that stock prices are quoted in fractions instead of the usual\\ndecimals, so $37.75 becomes $373/ 4. This old-fashioned numbering system dates\\nback to the Spaniards, who divided their money into eighths—that’s why parrots\\nin the pirate movies are always squawking about “pieces of eight.”\\nWall Street has kept up the practice of doing its calculations in eighths, so\\ninstead of hearing that such-and-such a stock is “up ten cents today,” you’ll hear\\nthat it’s up “an eighth of a point,” and instead of “up twenty-five cents,” it’s up\\n“a quarter of a point.” A “point” is Wall-Streetese for “dollar.”', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='In the four columns to the far right, “High,” “Low,” “Last,” and “Chg”\\n(Change), you get a recap of what happened in yesterday’s trading. In this case,\\nnothing much. The highest price anybody paid for Disney during this particular\\nsession was $573/ 4, and the lowest was $563/ 4, and the last sale of the day was\\nmade at $575/ 8. That was the closing price that everybody was looking for in the\\nnewspaper. It was up $0.25 from the closing price of the day before, which is\\nwhy +1/\\n4\\nappears in the “Chg” column.\\nDirectly to the right of the word “Stock” is “Div,” which stands for\\n“dividend.” Dividends are a company’s way of rewarding the people who buy\\ntheir stock. Some companies pay big dividends, some pay small dividends, and\\nsome pay no dividend at all. You’ll learn more about dividends later.\\nThe number shown here, .36, means “thirty-six cents.” That’s Disney’s\\ncurrent annual dividend—you get thirty-six cents for each share you own.\\nIn the column under the next heading, “Yld %” (Yield), you get more\\ninformation about the dividend, so you can compare it, say, to the yield from a\\nsavings account or bond. Here, they’ve taken Disney’s thirty-six-cent annual\\npayout and divided it by the closing stock price ($575/ 8). The result is 0.625\\npercent—the return you’re getting on your money if you invest in Disney at the\\ncurrent price.\\nThis 0.625 percent is a very low return, as compared to the 3 percent that\\nsavings accounts are paying these days. Disney is not a stock you’d buy just for\\nthe dividend.\\nTo the right of “Yld,” there’s “P/E.” “P/E” is an abbreviation for “price-\\nearnings ratio.” You get the p/e ratio by dividing the price of a stock by the\\ncompany’s annual earnings. But there’s no need to do the math yourself, because\\nthe p/e can be found in the paper every day.\\nWhen people are considering whether to buy a particular company, the p/e\\nhelps them figure out if the stock is cheap or expensive. P/e ratios vary from\\nindustry to industry, and to some extent from company to company, so the\\nsimplest way to use this tool is to compare a company’s current p/e ratio to the\\nhistorical norm.\\nIn today’s market, the p/e of the average stock is about 16, and Disney’s p/e\\nof 23 makes it a bit expensive relative to the average stock. But since Disney’s\\np/e ratio has moved from 12 to 40 over the past fifteen years, a p/e of 23 for\\nDisney is not out of line, historically.

That’s why it’s in their best interest to\\nmake sure the company sticks to the facts and doesn’t exaggerate. They know\\nthe truth will come out sooner or later, because companies are watched by\\nhundreds, if not thousands of shareholders. A baseball player can’t brag about\\nhis .320 average when all the fans who read the box scores every day know he’s\\nhitting .220. It’s the same on Wall Street. A company can’t brag about its record-\\nbreaking earnings if the earnings aren’t there—too many investors are paying\\nclose attention.\\nThat Dirty Word—Profit\\nCompanies are in business for one basic reason. No matter whether they are\\npublic or private, owned by a single shareholder or a million shareholders, the', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='goal is the same. They want to make a profit.\\nProfit is the money that’s left over after all the bills are paid.

You\\nwouldn’t want to stand out in the hot sun with a bucket and a soapy sponge if\\nyou didn’t expect to come away with a profit. Maybe you enjoy washing cars\\nbecause you can hose yourself down every once in a while and it keeps you cool\\nin the summertime, but that doesn’t mean you’d do it for free.\\nThe same is true of people who own shares in companies. They’re not doing\\nit just for the fun of getting invited to the annual meeting, or getting a copy of\\nthe annual report sent to them in the mail. They’re doing it because they expect\\nthe company in which they own shares to make a profit and to pass along some\\nof that profit to them, sooner or later.\\nThere’s a mistaken idea still floating around that people who do things for\\nprofit are being greedy or underhanded, and they’re trying to pull a fast one on\\nthe rest of society, because whenever one person makes a bundle, it’s at the\\nexpense of everybody else.\\nA generation ago, there were more subscribers to this idea than there are\\ntoday, but it’s still lurking in the backs of more than a few minds. That one\\nman’s gain is another man’s pain was the basic doctrine of communism, and it\\nwas also fashionable among socialists on college campuses and elsewhere, who\\nnever missed a chance to accuse capitalists of putting themselves first and\\neverybody else last, and of getting rich on the sore backs of the wage earners.\\nEarlier we mentioned Adam Smith’s book The Wealth of Nations, which is\\nstill popular two hundred years later. You might want to take a crack at it. As\\nlong as we have capitalism and the profit motive, Smith’s Invisible Hand is there\\nto guide the money to the places where it can do the most good.\\nPersonal computers are a recent example of the Invisible Hand in action.\\nWhen PCs were invented and people became attracted to them, a slew of new\\ncompanies was formed, and investors lined up to buy shares and sink billions of\\ndollars into the computer industry. The result was better and faster computers\\nthat could be manufactured more cheaply, and the fierce competition kept the\\ncosts down. The fierce competition also put a lot of companies out of business,\\nbut the ones that survived made the best products at the lowest prices.\\nIt’s not only in the animal world that we have survival of the fittest. It\\nhappens in the capitalist world as well. Profitable companies with good\\nmanagement are rewarded in the stock market, because when a company does', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='well, the stock price goes up. This makes investors happy, including the\\nmanagers and employees who own shares.\\nIn a poorly managed company, the results are mediocre, and the stock price\\ngoes down, so bad management is punished. A decline in the stock price makes\\ninvestors angry, and if they get angry enough, they can pressure the company to\\nget rid of the bad managers and take other actions to restore the company’s\\nprofitability.\\nWhen all is said and done, a highly profitable company can attract more\\ninvestment capital than a less profitable company. With the extra money it gets,\\nthe highly profitable company is nourished and made stronger, and it has the\\nresources to expand and grow. The less profitable company has trouble attracting\\ncapital, and it may wither and die for lack of financial nourishment.\\nThe fittest survive and the weakest go out of business, so no more money is\\nwasted on them. With the weakest out of the way, the money flows to those who\\ncan make better use of it.\\nAll employees everywhere ought to be rooting for profit, because if the\\ncompany they work for doesn’t make one, they’ll soon be out of a job. Profit is a\\nsign of achievement. It means somebody has produced something of value that\\nother people are willing to buy. The people who make the profit are motivated to\\nrepeat their success on a grander scale, which means more jobs and more profits\\nfor others.\\nIf there is any truth to the charge that capitalists and investors are selfish and\\ngreedy, thinking only of fattening their own bankrolls, why is the wealthiest\\ncountry in the world also the most charitable? Americans are found at the top of\\nthe money-giving chart, and individuals do most of the giving. In 1994, for\\ninstance, U.S. residents pulled $105 billion from their own pockets to help the\\nhomeless and the infirm, the jobless and the elderly, the hospitals and the\\nchurches, the museums and the schools, the veterans and United Way, Jerry’s\\nKids and a host of other good causes.\\nCapitalism is not a zero-sum game. Except for a few crooks, the rich do not\\nget that way by making other people poor. When the rich get richer, the poor get\\nricher as well. If it were really true that the rich get richer at the expense of the\\npoor, then since we’re the richest country in the world, by now we surely would\\nhave created the most desperate class of poor people on earth. Instead, we’ve\\ndone just the opposite.\\nThere is substantial poverty in America, but it doesn’t come close to matching\\nthe poverty you’ll see in parts of India, Latin America, Africa, Asia, or Eastern', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='Europe where capitalism is just beginning to take hold. When companies\\nsucceed and become more profitable, it means more jobs and less poverty, the\\nopposite of what the government has been telling us.\\nThe Growth Factory\\nEvery person who owns shares in a company wants it to grow. That doesn’t\\nmean it gets too big for its britches and has to move to a larger building,\\nalthough moving to a larger building is a sign of growth. It means the profits are\\ngrowing. The company will earn more money this year than last year, just as it\\nearned more money last year than the year before that. When investors talk about\\n“growth,” they’re not talking about size. They’re talking about profitability, that\\nis, earnings.\\nIf you wash three cars for $6 each, and you spent $2 on a plastic bottle of\\nsoap and $1 on a new sponge, you’ve earned $15—the $18 you got for doing the\\njob minus $3 for the materials. Wash another five cars with the same soap and\\nthe same sponge, and you’ll earn another $30, with no additional cost for the\\nmaterials. Your earnings have just tripled. That’s more cash in your pocket so\\nyou can buy CDs, movie tickets, new clothes, or more shares of stock.\\nA company doubling its earnings in twelve months can cause a wild\\ncelebration on Wall Street, because it’s very rare for a business to grow that fast.\\nBig, established companies are happy to see their earnings increase by 10 to 15\\npercent a year, and younger, more energetic companies may be able to increase\\ntheirs by 25 to 30 percent, but one way or the other, the name of the game is\\nearnings. That’s what the shareholders are looking for, and that’s what makes the\\nstocks go up.\\nThink of it this way. You’ve got a friend who’s starting a rock group. The\\nfriend needs money for some music equipment. So he makes you the following\\noffer. If you put up $1,000 for the high-powered amplifier, he’ll give you 10\\npercent ownership in the band. The two of you sign a paper to this effect.\\nBefore the band squawks its first squawk, it looks as if you’ve made a dumb\\ndeal. It cost you $1,000 for 10 percent ownership in a group whose only asset is\\nthe amplifier you paid for. At this point, you’re getting a 10 percent stake in your\\nown amplifier. But let’s say the rock group is hired by a local club to play the\\nFriday night dances at $200 a week. Now the band has a value that goes beyond\\nthe amplifier. It has earnings. Your 10 percent of the earnings will pay you $20 a\\nweek.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='Then if the band makes a hit with the crowd and gets a raise to $400, the\\nearnings double overnight, and all of a sudden you’re getting $40 a week.\\nBy this time, the piece of paper you’ve got is no longer worthless. You could\\nprobably sell it if you wanted to. But if you believe in this rock group, you’ll\\nhold on to your shares, because someday the band might cut a record and get on\\nMTV and become the next Pearl Jam or Hootie and the Blowfish. If that\\nhappens, you’ll be making thousands of dollars a week from the earnings, and\\nyour 10 percent stake will be worth far more than you could have dreamed at the\\ntime you provided the amplifier.\\nPeople who buy shares in Disney, or Reebok, or any other public company do\\nit for the same reason you’d invest in a rock group. They’re counting on Disney,\\nReebok, or whatever to increase their earnings, and they expect that a portion of\\nthese earnings will get back to them in the form of higher stock prices.\\nThis simple point—that the price of a stock is directly related to a company’s\\nearning power—is often overlooked, even by sophisticated investors. The\\ntickertape watchers begin to think stock prices have a life of their own. They\\ntrack the ups and downs, the way a bird watcher might track a fluttering duck.\\nThey study the trading patterns, making charts of every zig and zag. They try to\\nfathom what the “market” is doing, when they ought to be following the earnings\\nof the companies whose stocks they own.\\nIf earnings continue to rise, the stock price is destined to go up. Maybe it\\nwon’t go up right away, but eventually it will rise. And if the earnings go down,\\nit’s a pretty safe bet the price of the stock will go down. Lower earnings make a\\ncompany less valuable, just like the rock band that loses its audience and stops\\nselling records.\\nThis is the starting point for the successful stockpicker: Find companies that\\ncan grow their earnings over many years to come. It’s not by accident that stocks\\nin general rise in price an average of about 8 percent a year over the long term.\\nThat occurs because companies in general increase their earnings at 8 percent a\\nyear, on average, plus they pay 3 percent as a dividend.\\nBased on these assumptions, the odds are in your favor when you invest in a\\nrepresentative sample of companies. Some will do better than others, but in\\ngeneral, they’ll increase earnings by 8 percent and pay you a dividend of 3\\npercent, and you’ll arrive at your 11 percent annual gain.\\nBy itself, the price of a stock doesn’t tell you a thing about whether you’re\\ngetting a good deal. You’ll hear people say: “I’m avoiding IBM, because at $100\\na share it’s too expensive.” It may be that they don’t have $100 to spend on a', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='share of IBM, but the fact that a share costs $100 has nothing to do with whether\\nIBM is expensive. A $150,000 Lamborghini is out of most people’s price range,\\nbut for a Lamborghini, it still might not be expensive. Likewise, a $100 share of\\nIBM may be a bargain, or it may not be. It depends on IBM’s earnings.\\nIf IBM is earning $10 a share this year, then you’re paying 10 times earnings\\nwhen you buy a share for $100. That’s a p/e ratio of 10, which in today’s market\\nis cheap. On the other hand, if IBM only earns $1 a share, then you’re paying\\n100 times earnings when you buy that $100 share. That’s a p/e ratio of 100,\\nwhich is way too much to pay for IBM.\\nThe p/e ratio is a complicated subject that merits further study, if you are\\nserious about picking your own stocks. But while we’re on the topic, here are\\nsome pointers about p/e’s.\\nIf you take a large group of companies, add their stock prices together, and\\ndivide by their earnings, you get an average p/e ratio. On Wall Street they do this\\nwith the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&P 500 stocks, and other such indexes. The\\nresult is known as the “market multiple” or “what the market is selling for.”\\nThe market multiple is a useful thing to be aware of, because it tells you how\\nmuch investors are willing to pay for earnings at any given time. The market\\nmultiple goes up and down, but it tends to stay within the boundaries of 10 and\\n20. The stock market in mid-1995 had an average p/e ratio of about 16, which\\nmeant that stocks in general weren’t cheap, but they weren’t outrageously\\nexpensive, either.\\nIn general, the faster a company can grow its earnings, the more investors will\\npay for those earnings. That’s why aggressive young companies have p/e ratios\\nof 20 or higher. People are expecting great things from these companies and are\\nwilling to pay a higher price to own the shares. Older, established companies\\nhave p/e ratios in the mid to low teens. Their stocks are cheaper relative to\\nearnings, because established companies are expected to plod along and not do\\nanything spectacular.\\nSome companies steadily increase their earnings—they are the growth\\ncompanies. Others are erratic earners, the rags-to-riches types. They are the\\ncyclicals—the autos, the steels, the heavy industries that do well only in certain\\neconomic climates. Their p/e ratios are lower than the p/e’s of steady growers,\\nbecause their performance is erratic. What they will earn from one year to the\\nnext depends on the condition of the economy, which is a hard thing to predict,\\nas you’ll see in Chapter Four.\\nThat a company earns a lot of money doesn’t necessarily mean the', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='stockholders will benefit. The next big question is: What does the company plan\\nto do with this money? Basically, it has four choices.\\nIt can plow the money back into the business, in effect investing in itself. It\\nuses this money to open more stores or build new factories and grow its earnings\\neven faster than before. In the long run, this is highly beneficial to the\\nstockholders. A fast-growing company can take every dollar and make a 20\\npercent return on it. That’s far more than you or I could get by putting that dollar\\nin the bank.\\nOr it can waste the money on corporate jets, teak-paneled offices, marble in\\nthe executive bathrooms, executive salaries that are double the going rate, or\\nbuying other companies and paying too much for them. Such unnecessary\\npurchases are bad for stockholders and can ruin what otherwise would be a very\\ngood investment.\\nOr a company can buy back its own shares and take them off the market. Why\\nwould any company want to do such a thing? Because with fewer shares on the\\nmarket, the remaining shares become more valuable. Share buybacks can be very\\ngood for the stockholders, especially if the company is buying its own shares at a\\ncheap price.\\nFinally, the company can pay a dividend. A majority of companies do this.\\nDividends are not entirely a positive thing—a company that pays one is giving\\nup the chance to invest that money in itself. Nevertheless, dividends are very\\nbeneficial to shareholders.\\nA dividend is a company’s way of paying you to own the stock. The money\\ngets sent to you directly on a regular basis—it’s the only one of our four options\\nin which the company’s profits go directly into your pocket. If you need income\\nwhile you’re holding on to the stock, the dividend does the trick. Or you can use\\nthe dividend to buy more shares.\\nDividends also have a psychological benefit. In a bear market or a correction,\\nno matter what happens to the price of the stock, you’re still collecting the\\ndividend. This gives you an extra reason not to sell in a panic.\\nMillions of investors buy dividend-paying stocks and nothing else. If you are\\ninterested in this kind of investing, you might want to get in touch with Moody’s\\nInvestors Service, a Wall Street research firm. Among other things, Moody’s\\ncompiles a list of companies that have raised their dividends for many years in a\\nrow. One company has been doing it for fifty years, and more than three hundred\\nhave been doing it for ten.\\nThe list appears in Moody’s Handbook of Dividend Achievers, along with a', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='complete statistical rundown on each of the companies that have gotten into this\\ndividend-raising habit. To order the latest copy of this book, call Moody’s at 1-\\n800-342-5647.\\nHow to Catch a Twelve-Bagger\\nIf you’re going to invest in a stock, you have to know the story. This is where\\ninvestors get themselves in trouble. They buy a stock without knowing the story,\\nand they track the stock price, because that’s the only detail they understand.\\nWhen the price goes up, they think the company is in great shape, but when the\\nprice stalls or goes down, they get bored or they lose faith, so they sell their\\nshares.\\nConfusing the price with the story is the biggest mistake an investor can\\nmake. It causes people to bail out of stocks during crashes and corrections, when\\nthe prices are at their lowest, which they think means that the companies they\\nown must be in lousy shape. It causes them to miss the chance to buy more\\nshares when the price is low, but the company is still in terrific shape.\\nThe story tells you what’s happening inside the company to produce profits in\\nthe future—or losses, if it’s a tale of woe. It’s not always easy to figure this out.\\nSome stories are more complicated than others. Companies that have many\\ndifferent divisions are harder to follow than companies that make a single\\nproduct. And even when the story is simple, it may not be conclusive.\\nBut there are occasions when the picture is clear and the average investor is in\\na perfect position to see how exciting it is. These are the times when\\nunderstanding a company can really pay off. Let’s consider two examples from\\ndifferent periods: Nike in 1987, and Johnson & Johnson in 1994.\\nNike is a simple business. It makes sneakers. Along with fast food and\\nspecialty retailers, this is the sort of company that anybody can follow. (See\\nchart on page 164.) There are three key elements: First, is Nike selling more\\nsneakers this year than last year? Second, is it making decent profit on the\\nsneakers it sells? Third, will it sell more sneakers next year, and the years after\\nthat? In 1987, investors got some definite answers, which arrived in the quarterly\\nreports and the annual report sent to every shareholder.\\nSince going public in 1980, Nike stock had been bouncing all over the place:\\njumping from $5 in 1984 to $10 in 1986, falling back to $5, rebounding to $10 in\\n1987. Looking at the scenery for this story, the prospects for sneakers couldn’t\\nhave been brighter. Everybody was wearing them: toddlers, teenagers, even', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='adults who hadn’t worn sneakers since they were kids. There were different\\nsneakers for tennis, jogging, basketball, you name it. It was obvious the demand\\nfor sneakers was growing, and Nike was a big supplier.\\nYet the company had run into a rough stretch where its sales, earnings, and\\nfuture sales were all declining. This was a very depressing turn of events, as\\nshareholders found out when they received their first-quarter 1987 report. (As is\\nthe custom with many companies, Nike’s year begins in June, so the first quarter\\nof 1987 ends in August 1986.) If you owned Nike, you got the news in the mail\\nin early October 1986. Sales were down 22 percent, earnings down 38 percent,\\nand “futures” (future orders) down 39 percent. This was not a good time to buy\\nmore shares of Nike.\\nThe second-quarter report was mailed out January 6, 1987. The results were\\njust as bad as those in the first quarter, and the third quarter wasn’t much better.\\nThen lo and behold, in the fourth-quarter report, which arrived in late July 1987\\nalong with the annual report, there was a positive note. Sales were still down, but\\nonly by 3 percent; earnings were still down; but future orders had turned up. This\\nmeant that stores around the world were buying more Nike sneakers. They\\nwouldn’t be doing that unless they thought they could sell more Nike sneakers.\\nBy reading the annual report of that year, you would also have learned that in\\nspite of its several quarters of declining earnings, Nike was still making a nice\\nprofit. That’s because sneakers are a very low-cost business. It’s not like the\\nsteel business, where you have to build and maintain expensive factories. In the\\nsneaker business, all you need is a big room and a bunch of sewing machines\\nand relatively inexpensive materials. Nike had plenty of cash on hand and was in\\nexcellent financial shape.\\nWhen you opened the first-quarter report of 1988, which arrived in late\\nSeptember 1987, you could hardly believe your eyes. Sales were up 10 percent,\\nearnings up 68 percent, and future orders up 61 percent. This was proof that\\nNike was on a roll. In fact, the roll lasted for five more years: twenty straight\\nquarters of higher sales and higher earnings.\\nIn September 1987, you didn’t know yet about the twenty straight quarters.\\nYou were happy the company had turned itself around, but you weren’t rushing\\nout to buy more stock. You were worried about the price, which had moved up\\nsharply from $7 to $12.50.\\nSo you awaited further developments, and this time you got. lucky. Stock\\nprices came tumbling down in the Crash of October 1987. Investors who confuse\\nthe stock price with the story were selling everything they owned, including their', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='Nike shares. They heard commentators on the nightly news predict a worldwide\\ncollapse of the financial markets.\\nIn the midst of this pandemonium, you kept your head, because you realized\\nthe Nike story was getting better. The Crash gave you a gift: the opportunity to\\nbuy more shares of Nike at a bargain price.\\nThe stock dropped to $7 after the Crash and sat at that level for eight days, so\\nyou had plenty of time to call your broker.

Peter Lynch was on to this one, not that it took any\\nparticular genius to figure it out. If you had seen the 1993 annual report, you\\nwould have arrived at the same conclusion: Invest in this company.\\nThe 1993 annual report was mailed out on March 10, 1994. The first thing\\nyou noticed on the inside cover was the fate of the stock over the past couple of\\nyears. It had been dropping steadily from about $57 at the end of 1991. At the\\ntime the report arrived, the stock had fallen to $395/ 8.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='For such a great company to have produced such a lousy stock in a rising\\nmarket, you suspected that something had to be wrong. You scanned the annual\\nreport for the bad news, but everywhere you looked, there was good news, much\\nof it summarized on page forty-two. The earnings had gone up steadily for ten\\nyears in a row and had quadrupled during that period. The sales had risen\\nsteadily as well.\\nThe company also mentioned it had raised the dividend ten years in a row, but\\nneglected to mention a more incredible fact: It had raised the dividend for thirty-\\ntwo years in a row. Perhaps Johnson & Johnson was trying to be modest.\\nAlso on page forty-two, you learned that the company had become more\\nproductive in recent years. In 1983, Johnson & Johnson, with 77,400 employees,\\nmanufactured and sold $6 billion worth of products, while in 1993, with 81,600\\nemployees, it manufactured and sold $14 billion worth of products. That’s more\\nthan twice as much manufacturing and selling, with only 4,200 additional\\nemployees. From 1989 to 1993, the sales increased from $9.7 billion to $14\\nbillion and the number of employees dropped.\\nThis told you that Johnson & Johnson was getting to be highly efficient and\\nadept at cutting costs. The company’s workers were using their time more\\neffectively. They were producing more value for the company, for the\\nshareholders (although you couldn’t see it in the stock price), and for\\nthemselves. Many of the workers owned shares, and even if they didn’t, when\\nsales went up, and profits went up, they got raises.\\nOn pages twenty-five and forty-two, you found out that Johnson & Johnson\\nhad been buying back its own shares: 3 million shares in 1993, 110 million\\nshares in a decade. It spent billions of dollars in this effort. When a company\\ntakes its own shares off the market in this fashion, the investors are likely to\\nbenefit. Fewer shares means higher earnings per share, which leads to a higher\\nstock price. Looking at Johnson & Johnson’s stock price, you wouldn’t think\\nthere’d been a buyback.\\nThe balance sheet on page twenty-nine of Johnson & Johnson’s annual report\\nshowed that the company had over $900 million in cash and marketable\\nsecurities, and the company was worth $5.5 billion—its “total equity.” It owed\\n$1.5 billion in long-term debt, a modest amount for a company with $5.5 billion\\nin equity. With this much financial clout, Johnson & Johnson is no threat to go\\nout of business.\\nBy this time, you’re wondering what the flaw in this story is. Could it be that\\nJohnson & Johnson hadn’t prepared itself for the future? The headline on the', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='cover of the annual report suggested otherwise. Right there in big letters it said,\\n“Growth Through New Products.” The text gave the details: 34 percent of the\\ncompany’s 1993 sales came from products introduced to the market in the last\\nfive years.\\nOn page forty-two, you discover that Johnson & Johnson spent more than $1\\nbillion on research and development in 1993—8 percent of sales. The R&D\\nbudget had more than doubled in ten years. Obviously, the company was doing\\nwhat the headline said: growing new products. It hadn’t been caught napping.\\nTo put this story into a larger context, you compared the price of the stock to\\nthe earnings. The company was expected to earn $3.10 in 1994, and $3.60 in\\n1995, giving it a price/earnings ratio of 12 and 11, respectively. Future earnings\\nare always hard to predict, but Johnson & Johnson had had very predictable\\nresults in the past. So, if these estimates turned out to be correct, the stock was\\ncheap.\\nAt the time, the average stock was selling for sixteen times its estimated 1995\\nearnings. Johnson & Johnson was selling for eleven times its estimated 1995\\nearnings. And Johnson & Johnson was far better than your average company. It\\nwas a terrific company, doing everything right: earnings up, sales up, prospects\\nbright. Despite all this, the stock already had dropped to to $395/ 8, and it dropped\\nfurther, to nearly $36, in the weeks after the report arrived.\\nAs hard as it was to believe, you reached the inescapable conclusion: There\\nwas nothing wrong with Johnson & Johnson to cause the stock price to go down.\\nThe company wasn’t the problem, the “healthcare scare” was the problem. In\\n1993, Congress was debating various healthcare-reform proposals, including the\\nones advanced by the Clinton administration. Investors worried that healthcare\\ncompanies would suffer if the Clinton proposals became law. So they dumped\\nJohnson & Johnson along with the rest of their healthcare stocks. The entire\\nindustry took a beating in this period.\\nSome of this concern would have been justified if the Clintons had had their\\nway, but even then Johnson & Johnson would have been affected less than a\\ntypical healthcare company. On page forty-one of the annual report, you learned\\nthat over 50 percent of Johnson & Johnson’s profits came from its international\\nbusiness—the Clinton proposals couldn’t have affected that. Then on page\\ntwenty-six you found out that 20 percent of the company’s profits came from\\nshampoo, Band-Aids, and other consumer items that had nothing to do with\\npharmaceuticals, which the Clintons had targeted for reform. Either way you\\nsliced it, Johnson & Johnson had a limited exposure to the threat that people', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='were worried about.\\nIt didn’t take more than twenty minutes to read that annual report and decide\\nthat Johnson & Johnson at $395/\\n8\\nwas one of the bargains of the decade. Johnson\\n& Johnson is not a complicated story. You didn’t have to be a full-time\\nprofessional investor or a graduate of the Harvard Business School to figure it\\nout.\\nThis was an easy call: The stock was down, while the fundamentals of the\\ncompany were improving. As in the case of Nike, you didn’t have to rush to buy\\nshares. Peter Lynch recommended Johnson & Johnson in an article in USA\\nToday at the end of 1993, when the stock was selling for $447/ 8. In the spring of\\n1994 on Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser he recommended it again. By\\nthen, the stock was $7 cheaper at $37.\\nThe fact that it had dropped $7 didn’t bother Lynch at all. The latest quarterly\\nreport told him that sales and earnings were on the rise, so the story was getting\\nbetter. It was a perfect chance to buy more shares at the lower price.\\nLynch publicly recommended Johnson & Johnson once again in midsummer\\n1994. The stock had rebounded to $44, but it was still cheap on earnings. By\\nOctober, 1995, it had risen above $80. The price had doubled in eighteen\\nmonths.\\nJohnson & Johnson', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='nan', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='THREE\\nT L C\\nhe ives of a ompany\\nThe Company at Birth\\nThe story begins as follows. Somebody has a brainstorm and invents a new\\nproduct. It doesn’t have to be a VIP, a Ph.D., a Phi Beta Kappa, or a college\\ngraduate. It could even be a high-school dropout or a college dropout, and in the\\ncase of Apple Computer, it was two college dropouts.\\nIt’s amazing how many billion-dollar companies got launched on people’s\\nkitchen tables or out of their garages. The Body Shop started in Anita Roddick’s\\ngarage. She was a British housewife looking for something to do while her\\nhusband was away on business trips. So she made lotions and potions, and\\nturned them into a skin-care empire, with nine hundred Body Shops worldwide.\\nThe first Hewlett-Packard computer came out of David Packard’s garage, and\\nthe first Apple computer was created in the garage that belonged to Steve Jobs’s\\nparents. To encourage more innovation in the world, maybe we need to build\\nmore garages.\\nLet’s look more closely at the origins of Apple. The company was founded in\\n1976, two hundred years after the founding of the country. Today, it sells $5\\nbillion worth of computers worldwide every year, and pays the salaries of 11,300\\nworkers. But before 1976, Apple didn’t exist, except as a gleam in the eyes of\\ntwo California boys.\\nOne was Jobs, and the other was his buddy Steve Wozniak. Jobs was twenty-\\none at the time; Wozniak, twenty-six. That both were college dropouts gives\\nthem something in common with Ben Cohen, the Ben of Ben & Jerry’s ice\\ncream. All three left school early, started a company from scratch, and become\\nmulti-millionaires before they were thirty-five.\\nThat doesn’t mean you should drop out of school and wait for something\\nwonderful to happen. These three people knew how to read, write, and count,\\nand the two Steves had already learned a great deal about computers. They\\ndidn’t leave school so they could sleep late and goof off the rest of the day. They', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='fiddled around with transistors, wires, and printed circuits.\\nWozniak was one of the original “hackers”—pesky computer whizzes who\\nexperimented with homemade equipment and learned how to break security\\ncodes and invade databases and create havoc in government agencies and\\ncorporate offices. On a more constructive note, he thought about designing a\\nsimple computer that could be used at home by people who had never handled\\none, and who were so confused by the whole business that they couldn’t tell a\\ndisk drive from a disc jockey. That was 99.9 percent of the population.\\nSo Wozniak and Jobs set up shop in the Jobs’s family garage, took some\\ngeneric computer parts and put them together in a plastic box, and called it the\\nApple I. Both of them got very excited about what they’d produced. They\\ndecided to sell everything they owned—which amounted to one old van and two\\ncalculators—and sink the proceeds into the business.\\nThey raised thirteen hundred dollars of their own money, which at 1976\\nprices helped finance the production of fifty more Apples. Then they sold those\\nfifty and used that money to develop an improved model and sold several\\nhundred copies of that.\\nIn this first stage, the source of the bright idea is paying the bills out of his\\nown pocket. When the cash runs out, he hocks the family jewels, sells the second\\ncar, gets a home equity loan from the bank—whatever it takes to move the\\nproject along.\\nThe risk of losing their house, prized possessions, and life savings is a risk\\nthat many backyard inventors are ready to take in order to launch a fledgling\\nenterprise. These are people with grit and gumption, willing to wander into\\nuncharted territory just like the pioneers of old. In starting a new business, they\\nchoose excitement over the security of a regular paycheck. It’s not enough that\\nthey invest all their money in the project. They must also work long hours and\\ninvest most of their time.\\nIf they’re lucky and they don’t hit any snags or run out of money too quickly,\\nthey’ll be able to make a sample or a scale model of the gizmo they’ve invented,\\nor pay a consultant to write a detailed plan for the business they’re hoping to get\\ninto. At this point, they move to the exciting stage when even more money is\\nrequired. They pitch the project to an “angel.”\\nThe angel could be a rich uncle, a distant cousin, or a friend with big bucks\\nand a willingness to invest in a longshot. It’s not out of charity that angels put up\\nthe money. They do it because they are convinced the new idea has a fighting\\nchance to succeed. And in return for their capital, they ask for a share of the', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='business—often a rather large share.\\nAlready you can see that the person who has the great idea can’t hope to\\nsucceed by being selfish and keeping 100 percent ownership for him-or herself.\\nAs the project moves beyond the scale-model stage or the planning stage, more\\nmoney will have to be raised from new investors with bigger bankrolls. These\\nare the venture capitalists.\\nVenture capitalists usually enter the picture when the gizmo is in production,\\nand a sales force has been hired to sell it. They reduce their risk by waiting until\\nthe new company is established and the idea has already proven itself to some\\nextent. These people have a keen eye for detail, and they review every aspect of\\nthe company’s brief history looking for flaws. They want to know if the\\nmanagement knows what it’s about, and whether it has the ability to turn the\\noperation from small-time into big-time.\\nIn return for financial aid, the venture capitalists also demand a piece of the\\naction. Now our young company has three groups of owners: the original\\ninventor who put up the first batch of money; the angels who put up the second\\nbatch; and the venture capitalists who put up the third. By this time, the original\\ninventor may own less than 50 percent of the business, because the bigger the pie\\ngets, the more people with their fingers in it.\\nLet’s check in again on the progress of the two Steves at Apple. Sensing they\\nhad a popular product on their hands, they brought in a retired electronics\\nengineer who was also a marketing expert. His name was Mike Markkula.\\nMarkkula had worked for two giants in the computer industry: Intel and\\nFairchild Semiconductor. He was old enough to be the father of the two\\ninventors.\\nMarkkula could have dismissed the pair as the rank amateurs they were, but\\nhe knew a good thing when he saw it. Not only did he agree to write their\\nbusiness plan, he bought a one-third share of the company for $250,000—\\nmaking him Apple’s original angel.\\nPeople who are good at inventing things are not necessarily good at\\npromotion, advertising, finance, or personnel management—any one of which\\ncan make or break a young enterprise. Realizing the two Steves needed more\\nhelp than even he could give them, Markkula recruited Mike Scott, an\\nexperienced corporate executive, to be Apple’s president.\\nThe company also hired Regis McKenna, a veteran copywriter from one of\\nthe best advertising firms in the area, who designed the Apple logo. With these\\nnew associates taking care of marketing and promotion, the two Steves were free', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='to concentrate on improving the product.\\nApple was the first personal computer to offer color graphics, and the first to\\nuse a TV monitor as a screen. Wozniak installed a disk drive to replace the\\ncassette tapes that were used to store data in those days. By June 1977, they’d\\nsold $1 million worth of Apples, and by the end of 1978, when they introduced\\nthe Apple II, Apple was one of the fastest-growing companies in the United\\nStates.\\nAs sales continued to climb, the two Steves kept themselves busy in the\\nApple lab (no more garages for them!) designing more Apples. Meanwhile, in\\n1979, they raised more money: Wozniak sold some of his stock to financier\\nFayez Sarofim, and a group of venture capitalists organized by the L. F.\\nRothschild company invested $7.2 million.\\nThe company had produced its fourth new model by the time it went public in\\nDecember 1980. This is typical—Apple waited until it had proven itself and the\\nApples were flying off the shelves before going public.\\nGoing Public\\nIt’s in this stage that the stock market comes into play. By now, the company has\\nrefined its gizmo and taken the kinks out of it and is preparing for a full-scale\\nexpansion. Or, if the original idea was a new kind of store, the first store has\\nalready proven itself, and the company is already planning a second store, and a\\nthird, and so on. This sort of ambitious campaign requires more money than the\\nangels and venture capitalists have kicked in so far, and the best place to get it is\\nfrom you and me.\\nIt’s a momentous decision to take a company public, not unlike the decision\\nof a private person to run for public office. Once you do either, you open\\nyourself up to reporters sticking their noses into your business and government\\nagencies following your every move. The life of a politician is no longer his or\\nher own, and neither is the life of a company that goes from private to public.\\nCompanies take this step and put up with the hassles of living in a fishbowl,\\nbecause going public is their best chance to raise enough money to reach their\\nfull potential.\\nA company has two important birthdays—the day it incorporates and the day\\nit goes public. This blessed event is called the “initial public offering.” Each\\nyear, hundreds of stocks are born in this fashion, with an assist from the\\ninvestment-banking firms that oversee the delivery.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='The bankers’ part of the job, selling the shares to interested parties, is called\\nthe underwriting. These bankers go out on a “road show,” where they try to\\nconvince would-be investors to buy the stock. These would-be investors are\\ngiven a document (the “prospectus”) that explains everything about the\\ncompany, including all the reasons why they shouldn’t buy the stock. These\\nwarnings are printed in large red letters so people can’t say they didn’t see them.\\nOn Wall Street, the warning labels are called “red herrings.”\\nIn the prospectus, the bankers must also estimate the price at which the first\\nshares will be sold. Usually, they pick a range, say, from twelve dollars to\\nsixteen dollars, with the final price determined by what sort of reception they get\\non the road show.\\nThe bankers publicize an underwriter by putting in the papers an ad called a\\ntombstone. The so-called lead bank on the deal gets its name in a prominent spot\\non the tombstone. You’d be surprised at the squabbling and jostling that goes on\\nbehind the scenes among banks that compete to get the credit for being the lead\\nbank.

These initial shares are usually reserved for “big” investors, such as fund\\nmanagers who have millions, and even billions of dollars to work with.\\nThe 4.6-million-share offering for Apple Computer was sold out within an\\nhour, and mutual-fund managers were scrambling to get their hands on as many\\nshares as they could. As usual, amateur investors were shut out of the deal,\\nespecially in Massachusetts. Many states have “blue-sky” laws to protect the\\npublic from fraudent promotions, and the Massachussetts regulators put Apple in\\nthat category. They coudn’t have been more wrong.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='In any event, once an offering is completed, the proceeds are divided. A small\\nchunk of the money goes to the underwriters—the investment banks that\\norganized the road show and put together the deal.

Whatever it’s\\nbeen doing doesn’t seem to be working anymore. It abandons the old routines\\nand thrashes around looking for a new identity. This sort of crisis happens all the\\ntime. It happened to Apple.\\nIn late 1980, just after Apple went public, it came out with a lemon: the Apple\\nIII. Production was halted while the problems were ironed out, but by then it was\\ntoo late.

So to recover from its Apple III\\nfiasco, Apple had to act fast. Heads rolled in the front office, where several\\nexecutives were demoted.\\nThe company developed new software programs, opened offices in Europe,\\ninstalled hard disks in some of its computers. On the plus side, Apple reached $1\\nbillion in annual sales in 1982, but on the minus side, it was losing business to\\nIBM, its chief rival. IBM was cutting into Apple’s territory: personal computers.\\nInstead of concentrating on what it knew best, Apple tried to fight back by\\ncutting in on IBM’s territory: business computers. It created the Lisa, a snazzy\\nmachine that came with a new gadget: the mouse. But in spite of the mouse, the\\nLisa didn’t sell. Apple’s earnings took a tumble, and so did the stock price—\\ndown 50 percent in a year.\\nApple was less than ten years old, but it was having a full-blown midlife\\ncrisis. Investors were dismayed, and the company’s management was feeling the\\nheat. Employees got the jitters and looked for other jobs. Mike Markkula,\\nApple’s president, resigned. John Sculley, former president of Pepsi-Co, was\\nbrought in for the rescue attempt. Sculley was no computer expert, but he knew\\nmarketing. Marketing is what Apple needed.\\nApple was split into two divisions, Lisa and Macintosh. There was spirited\\nrivalry between the two. The Macintosh had a mouse like the Lisa and was\\nsimilar in other respects, but it cost much less and was easier to use. Soon, the\\ncompany abandoned the Lisa and put all its resources into the Macintosh.

You can’t blame them for getting tired. They’ve done it all and seen it all,\\nand there’s hardly a place they can go that they haven’t already been.\\nTake Woolworth. It’s been around for more than one hundred years—several\\ngenerations of Americans grew up shopping at Woolworth’s. At one point, there\\nwas a Woolworth’s outlet in every city and town in America. That’s when the\\ncompany ran out of room to grow.\\nRecently, Woolworth has suffered a couple of unprofitable years. It can still\\nmake a profit, but it will never be the spectacular performer it was when it was\\nyounger. Old companies that were great earners in the past can’t be expected to\\nkeep up the momentum. A few of them have—Wrigley’s, Coca-Cola, Emerson\\nElectric, and McDonald’s come to mind. But these are exceptions.\\nU.S. Steel, General Motors, and IBM are three prime examples of former\\nchampions whose most exciting days are behind them—although IBM and GM\\nare having a rebound. U.S. Steel was once an incredible hulk, the first billion-\\ndollar company on earth. Railroads needed steel, cars needed steel, skyscrapers\\nneeded steel, and U.S. Steel provided 60 percent of it.

We were a nation of factories then, and a\\ngood deal of our wealth and power came from the mill towns of the East and the\\nMidwest.\\nThe steel business was a fantastic business to be in, and U.S. Steel prospered\\nthrough both world wars and six different presidents. The stock hit an all-time\\nhigh of $1087/8 in August 1959.\\nThis was the beginning of the electronic age and the end of the industrial age\\nand the glory of steel, and it would have been the perfect time for investors to\\nsell their U.S. Steel shares and buy shares in IBM. But you had to be a very\\nfarsighted and unsentimental investor to realize this. After all, U.S. Steel was\\nclassed as a blue chip, Wall Street’s term of endearment for prestigious\\ncompanies that are expected to excel forever. Hardly anyone would have\\npredicted that in 1995, U.S. Steel stock would be selling for less than it sold for\\nin 1959.\\nTo put this decline in perspective, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was\\nbumping up against the five hundred level in 1959, and it’s gone up more than\\nfour thousand points since. So while stocks in the Dow have increased in value\\nmore than eight times over, U.S. Steel has gone downhill. Loyal shareholders\\nhave died and gone to heaven waiting for U.S. Steel to reclaim its lost glory.\\nThere’s a lesson here that may save you some grief in the future. No matter\\nhow powerful it may be today, a company won’t stay on top forever. Being\\ncalled a “blue-chip” or a “world-class operation” can’t save a company whose\\ntime is past, any more than Great Britain was saved by having the word “Great”\\nin its name.\\nLong after Great Britain had lost its empire, the British people continued to\\nthink of their country as stronger and mightier than it really was, the same as the\\nshareholders of U.S. Steel.\\nInternational Harvester, the dominant force in farm equipment for an entire\\nhalf-century, peaked in 1966 and never came back, even though it tried to\\nchange its luck by changing its name to Navistar.

Today, GM is still the largest company in the United\\nStates, and first in total sales, but it’s far from the most profitable. Sometime in\\nthe 1960s, its reflexes began to slow.\\nThe Germans came ashore with their Volkswagens and their BMWs, and the\\nJapanese invaded with their Toyotas and Hondas. The attack was aimed directly\\nat Detroit, and GM was slow to react. A younger, more aggressive GM might\\nhave risen to this challenge more quickly, but the older GM was set in its ways.\\nIt continued to make big cars when it could see that small foreign cars were\\nselling like crazy. Before it could build new models that could compete with the\\noverseas models, it had to overhaul its outmoded factories. This cost billions of\\ndollars, and by the time the overhaul was complete, and small cars were rolling\\noff the GM assembly lines, the public had switched back to bigger cars.\\nFor three decades the largest industrial company in the United States has not\\nbeen largely profitable. Yet if you had predicted this result in 1965, when GM\\nwas riding the crest of its fame and fortune, nobody would have believed you.\\nPeople would sooner have believed that Elvis was lip-synching.\\nThen there’s IBM, which had reached middle age in the late 1960s, about the\\ntime GM was in decline. Since the early 1950s, IBM was a spectacular\\nperformer and a great stock to own. It was a top brand name and a symbol of\\nquality—the IBM logo was getting to be as famous as the Coke bottle. The\\ncompany won awards for how well it was managed, and other companies studied\\nIBM to learn how they should run their operations. As late as the 1980s, it was\\ncelebrated in a bestselling book, In Search of Excellence.\\nThe stock was recommended by stockbrokers everywhere as the bluest of the\\nblue chips. To mutual-fund managers, IBM was a “must” investment. You had to\\nbe a maverick not to own IBM.\\nBut the same thing happened to IBM that happened to GM. Investors were so\\nimpressed with its past performance that they did not notice what was going on\\nin the present. People stopped buying the big mainframe computers that were the\\ncore of IBM’s business. The mainframe market wasn’t growing anymore. IBM’s\\npersonal-computer line was attacked from all sides by competitors who made a\\nless-expensive product. IBM’s earnings sank, and as you probably can guess by', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='now, so did the stock price.\\nBy now you might be wondering what’s the point of investing in a stodgy old\\ncompany such as IBM, GM, or U.S. Steel? There are several reasons you might\\ndo this. First, big companies are less risky, in that they generally are in no danger\\nof going out of business. Second, they are likely to pay a dividend. Third, they\\nhave valuable assets that might be sold off at a profit.\\nThese corporate codgers have been everywhere and seen it all, and they’ve\\npicked up all sorts of valuable property along the way. In fact, studying an old\\ncompany and delving into its finances can be as exciting as rummaging through\\nthe attic of a rich and elderly aunt. You never know what amazing stuff you’ll\\nfind stuck in a dark corner.\\nWhether it’s land, buildings, equipment, the stocks and bonds they keep in the\\nbank, or the smaller companies they’ve acquired along the way, old companies\\nhave a substantial “break-up value.” Shareholders act like the relatives of that\\naged rich aunt, waiting around to find out who will get what.\\nThere’s always the chance an old company can turn itself around, as Xerox\\nand American Express have been doing in the past couple of years.\\nOn the other hand, when an old company falters or stumbles as badly as these\\ncompanies did, it may take twenty or thirty years before it can get itself back on\\ntrack. Patience is a virtue, but it’s not well rewarded when you own stock in a\\ncompany that’s past its prime.\\nThe Corporate Soap Opera\\nThere are a lot of goings-on between companies. Watching them can be a great\\nsoap opera. If they aren’t getting married (called a “merger”), then they’re\\ngetting divorced (called a “divestiture” or the “spinoff of one of our divisions”).\\nOn top of that, there are “takeovers,” where one company is swallowed up by\\nanother. When the company that’s about to be swallowed doesn’t put up a fight,\\nwe call it a “friendly takeover.” When it objects to being swallowed and makes a\\nstruggle and tries to squirm out of it, we call it a “hostile takeover.”\\nThis isn’t as bad as it sounds, because in the world of finance, taking over a\\ncompany is generally considered acceptable behavior. It comes with the\\nterritory, because when a company goes public, it no longer controls who the\\nowners will be. It may try to protect itself from being taken over, but few\\ncompanies are takeover-proof. And since they have the right to do it to\\nsomebody else, they can’t get too mad when somebody else tries to do it to them.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='In either kind of takeover, friendly or hostile, the company that gets\\nswallowed loses its independence and becomes a division of the company that’s\\ndoing the swallowing. A good example of this is Kraft. Kraft was once an\\nindependent cheesemaker with its own stock that anyone could buy. It was\\nowned by individuals, mutual funds, and pension funds alike. Then along came\\nPhilip Morris.\\nThe directors of Philip Morris decided it was unwise for them to sell\\ncigarettes and nothing else. So they started taking over companies that made\\nother kinds of products, such as cheese and beer. A long time ago, they bought\\nthe Miller Brewing Company. They also acquired Wisconsin Tissue, 7 UP, and\\nGeneral Foods. In 1982, they bought Entenmann’s and got into the doughnut\\nbusiness, and in 1988, they took over Kraft.\\nThe way a takeover happens is that the acquiring company buys all the shares\\nfrom the thousands of different owners of the company being acquired, in this\\ncase, Kraft. Generally, the acquiring company, in this case, Philip Morris, makes\\na “tender offer” at a fixed price. As soon as Philip Morris gets its hands on 51\\npercent of the Kraft shares, the deal is all but done. It has majority control, and\\nfrom then on, it’s easy to convince the owners of the other 49 percent of Kraft to\\nsell their shares as well.\\nFriendly takeovers are short and sweet. If a company isn’t doing well on its\\nown, its shareholders will welcome the change in management. In most\\ninstances, they are delighted to sell their shares, because the acquiring company\\noffers a price that is generally much higher than the going rate for the shares on\\nthe stock market. The stock price of a target company may double or even triple\\novernight when the deal is announced.\\nA hostile takeover can turn into a knock-down, drag-out battle in the courts,\\nas well as a bidding war, if two or more companies are fighting over the same\\ntarget. These battles have been known to last for months. Once in a while, a flea\\nswallows an elephant, but usually it’s the other way around, and the company\\ndoing the swallowing is bigger than the company getting swallowed.\\nUsually, when a big company starts looking around for an acquisition, it’s got\\nmore cash in the bank than it knows what to do with. It could send this extra\\ncash to the shareholders as a special dividend or a bonus, but the people who run\\ncompanies will tell you that mailing out bonus checks isn’t nearly as exciting as\\nplotting a takeover and using the extra cash to finance it. Whatever kind of\\nbusiness they’re planning to take over, they’re convinced they can manage it\\nbetter and more profitably than the current leadership can. So these deals aren’t', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='only about money. They’re also about egos.\\nThe most successful mergers and takeovers are those in which the parties\\ninvolved are in the same line of work, or at least have something in common. In\\nromance, we call this “seeking a compatible partner.” In business, we call it\\n“synergy.”\\nGeorgia Pacific, a lumbering giant, once took over two smaller lumber\\ncompanies, Puget Sound Pulp & Timber Co. and Hudson Pulp & Paper, thereby\\nexpanding its operations. This was the classic “synergy” because all three were\\nin the tree business. They benefited from moving in together under the same roof\\nfor the same reason that couples benefit from getting married: Two, or in this\\ncase, three, can live more cheaply than one.\\nAnother example of classic “synergy” is Hershey’s acquisition of H. B. Reese\\nCandies, which took place in the 1960s. This was a strategic alliance between a\\nfamous peanut-butter cup and a famous chocolate bar, and both have lived\\nhappily ever since.\\nPepsi-Co has done well with its multiple takeovers of Kentucky Fried\\nChicken, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut, among other brand names. There’s a definite\\nsynergy between fast food and soft drinks. Pepsi’s fast-food restaurants sell a lot\\nof Pepsis along with their tacos, chicken, and pizza.\\nWith Philip Morris, it’s a little harder to detect the synergy between\\ncigarettes, cheese, beer, doughnuts, and toilet paper, until you realize that Philip\\nMorris has been buying great brand names that consumers recognize.\\nThere’s an ironic synergy in Heinz’s acquisitions of Star Kist tuna, Ore-Ida\\npotatoes, and Weight Watchers. One part of the company is selling groceries,\\nwhile the other part is selling diets. People laughed about the Weight Watchers,\\nbut Heinz understood how to make a brand name out of it and sell the product in\\nstores. It’s been a bonanza.\\nSara Lee, once known as the Kitchens of Sara Lee, went on a takeover binge\\nand captured Booth Fisheries, Oxford Chemical, and Fuller Brush, before\\nmoving into vacuum cleaners by taking over Electrolux. At that point, they were\\nselling cakes and the equipment to pick up the crumbs from the cakes, which is a\\nfarfetched sort of synergy. But the smartest thing Sara Lee ever did was to take\\nover Hanes. Hanes made the L’eggs stockings that caught the fancy of half the\\nwomen in the country.

Another champion\\nconglomerator was Charles Bluhdorn at Gulf & Western, who never saw a\\ncompany he didn’t want to take over. He acquired so many of them that Gulf &\\nWestern was known as Engulf and Devour. He did so many takeovers that when\\nhe died, Gulf & Western’s stock went up! Shareholders believed that the new\\nmanagement would sell off some of Bluhdorn’s acquisitions at a nice profit,\\nwhich is exactly what happened. Gulf & Western became Paramount\\nCommunications—until Paramount was taken over by Viacom.\\nThen there was American Can, which made numerous acquisitions from\\nmining companies to Sam Goody. This whole kaboodle was merged with Smith\\nBarney and the Commercial Credit Company, and its name was changed to\\nPrimerica. Primerica purchased Shearson from American Express and merged it\\ninto Smith Barney. Then Primerica bought Travelers Insurance and changed the\\nname Primerica to the Travelers Group.\\nFinally, there’s ITT, which has had more marriages than Elizabeth Taylor.\\nSince 1961, it has merged with or taken over no fewer than thirty-one different\\nenterprises, while later selling off six. The takeover list includes Avis Rent-A-\\nCar, Continental Baking, Levitt Furniture, Sheraton Hotels, Canteen Corp.,\\nEaton Oil, Minnesota National Life, Rayonier, Thorp Finance, Hartford\\nInsurance, and Pennsylvania Glass Sand. Along the way, ITT picked up Caesar’s\\nWorld and Madison Square Garden.\\nFor twenty-five years, all the takeover activity didn’t do ITT much good. The\\nstock went nowhere.

ITT\\nhas announced plans to split itself into three parts, with Caesar’s World and\\nMadison Square Garden included in one of the parts.\\nExtinct Companies\\nCompanies die every year. Some die young. They try to go too far too fast on\\nborrowed money they can’t pay back, and they crash.

The same goes for Studebaker, Nash, and Hudson\\nMotors, Remington Typewriter, and Central Leather.\\nThere’s one way a company can cease to exist without actually dying. It can\\nbe swallowed up by some other company in a takeover. And often, a company\\ncan avoid dying a quick death by seeking protection in a bankruptcy court.\\nBankruptcy court is the place where companies go when they can’t pay their\\nbills, and they need time to work things out. So they file for Chapter 11, a form\\nof bankruptcy that allows them to stay in business and gradually pay off their\\ndebts. The court appoints a trustee to oversee this effort and make sure everyone\\ninvolved is treated fairly.\\nIf it’s a terminal case and the company has no hope of restoring itself to\\nprofitability, it may file for Chapter 7. That’s when the doors are closed, the\\nemployees sent home, and the desks, lamps, and word processors are carted off\\nto be sold.\\nOften in these bankruptcies, the various groups that have a stake in the\\ncompany (workers, vendors, suppliers, investors) fight with each other over who\\ngets what. These warring factions hire expensive lawyers to argue their cases.\\nThe lawyers are well-paid, but rarely do the creditors get back everything they’re\\nowed. There are no funerals for bankrupt companies, but there can be a lot of\\nsorrow and grief, especially among workers, who lose their jobs, and\\nbondholders and stockholders, who lose money on their investments.\\nCompanies are so important to the health and prosperity of the country that\\nit’s too bad there isn’t a memorial someplace to the ones that have passed away.\\nOr perhaps the state historic preservation departments should put up plaques on\\nthe sites where these extinct companies once did business.

They mean the outside forces that companies must\\ncontend with, which help determine whether they make money or lose money,\\nand ultimately, whether they thrive or wither away.\\nAt one time, when 80 percent of the population owned farms or worked on\\nfarms, the economic climate had everything to do with weather. If a drought\\nburned up the crops, or they drowned in the rain, farmers couldn’t make money.\\nAnd when the farmers had no money, the local general store wasn’t doing any\\nbusiness, and neither were the suppliers to the general store. But when the\\nweather was favorable, farms produced a record harvest that put cash in farmers’\\npockets. The farmers spent the money at the general store, which put cash in the\\nstore owner’s pockets. The store owners would restock the shelves, which put\\ncash in the suppliers’ pockets. And so on.\\nNo wonder the weather—and not the stock market—was the favorite topic at\\nlunch counters and on street corners.

If you pay attention to the\\nbusiness news, you’ll see headlines that read: “Economy Strong, Nation\\nProsperous, Stock Market Drops 100 Points.”\\nThe main worry is that a hot economy and too much prosperity will lead to\\ninflation—the technical term for prices going up. Demand for goods and services\\nis high, which leads to a shortage of raw materials, and possibly a shortage of\\nworkers. Whenever there’s a shortage of anything, the prices tend to go up. Car\\nmanufacturers are paying more for steel, aluminum, and so forth, so they raise\\nthe prices of cars. When employees begin to feel the pinch of higher prices, they\\ndemand higher wages.\\nOne price hike leads to another, as businesses and workers take turns trying to\\nmatch the latest increase. Companies are paying more for electricity, raw\\nmaterials, and workers. Workers take home bigger paychecks but they lose the\\nadvantage because everything they buy is more expensive than it used to be.\\nLandlords are raising rents to cover their increased costs. Pretty soon, inflation is\\nout of control and prices are rising at 5 percent, 10 percent, or in extreme cases,\\nupwards of 20 percent a year. From 1979 to 1981, we had double-digit annual\\ninflation in the United States.\\nWith new stores being built and factories expanding all over the place, a lot of\\ncompanies are borrowing money to pay for their construction projects.\\nMeanwhile, a lot of consumers are borrowing money on their credit cards to pay\\nfor all the stuff they’ve been buying.

During the inflation of the late 1970s and early\\n1980s, stock and bond prices took a big fall.\\nA hot economy can’t stay hot forever. Eventually, there’s a break in the heat,\\nbrought about by the high cost of money. With higher interest rates on home\\nloans, car loans, credit-card loans, you name it, fewer people can afford to buy\\nhouses, cars, and so forth. So they stay where they are and put off buying the\\nnew house. Or they keep their old clunkers and put off buying a new car.\\nSuddenly, there’s a slump in the car business, and Detroit has trouble selling\\nits huge inventory of the latest models. The automakers are giving rebates, and\\ncar prices begin to fall a bit. Thousands of auto workers are laid off, and the\\nunemployment lines get longer. People out of work can’t afford to buy things, so\\nthey cut back on their spending.\\nInstead of taking the annual trip to Disney World, they stay home and watch\\nthe Disney Channel on TV.

You\\ncan see that they last an average of eleven months, and cause an average of 1.62\\nmillion people to lose their jobs.\\nIn a recession, business goes from bad to terrible. Companies that sell soft\\ndrinks, hamburgers, medicines—things that people either can’t do without or can\\neasily afford—can sail through a recession unscathed.

Back then, it didn’t have much economic clout. There was\\nno welfare, no social security, no housing department, none of the hundreds of\\ndepartments we have today. In 1935, the entire federal budget was $6.4 billion,\\nabout one-tenth of the total U.S. economy. Today, it’s $1.5 trillion, and nearly\\none-quarter of the total economy.\\nWe recently crossed an important divide: As of 1992, more people worked in\\nlocal, state, and federal governments than in manufacturing. This so-called\\npublic sector pays so many salaries and pumps so much money into the economy\\nthat it keeps the economy out of the deep freeze. Whether business is bad or\\ngood, millions of government employees, social security recipients, and welfare\\nrecipients still have money to spend. And when people get laid off, they get\\nunemployment compensation for several months while they look for another job.\\nThe dark side of this story is that the government has gotten out of whack,\\nwith huge budget deficits that soak up investment capital and keep the economy\\nfrom growing as fast it as once did. Too much of a good thing has become a bad\\nthing.\\nThe agency in charge of climate control is the Federal Reserve System, also\\nknown as the Fed. It has a special way of heating things up and cooling things\\ndown—not by blowing on them, but by adding and subtracting money. Given its', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='huge importance, it’s amazing how few people know what the Fed is all about.\\nIn a survey from several years ago, some people said the Federal Reserve was\\na national park, while others thought it was a brand of whiskey. In fact, it’s the\\ncentral banking system that controls the money supply. Whenever the economy\\nis cooling off too much, the Fed does two things. It lowers the interest rates that\\nbanks must pay when they borrow money from the government. This causes the\\nbanks to lower the interest rates they charge to their customers, so people can\\nafford to take out more loans and buy more cars and more houses. The economy\\nbegins to heat up.\\nThe Fed also pumps money directly into the banks, so they have more to lend.\\nThis pumping of money also causes interest rates to go down. And in certain\\nsituations, the government can spend more money and stimulate the economy\\nthe same way you do every time you spend money at a store.\\nIf the economy is too hot, the Fed can take the opposite approach: raising\\ninterest rates and draining money from the banks. This causes the supply of\\nmoney to shrink, and interest rates go higher. When this happens, bank loans\\nbecome too expensive for many consumers, who stop buying cars and houses.\\nThe economy starts to cool off. Businesses lose business, workers lose their jobs,\\nand store owners get lonely and slash prices to attract customers.\\nThen at some point, when the economy is thoroughly chilled, the Fed steps in\\nand heats it up again. The process goes on endlessly, and Wall Street is always\\nworried about it.\\nIn the last fifty years, we’ve had nine recessions, so in your lifetime, you’re\\nlikely to be subjected to a dozen or more. Each time it happens, you’ll hear from\\nthe reporters and the TV commentators that the country is falling apart and that\\nowning stocks is too risky. The thing to remember is that we’ve wiggled out of\\nevery recession since the one that turned into the Great Depression. The table on\\npage 195 shows that the average recession lasts eleven months and 1.62 million\\njobs are lost, while the average recovery lasts fifty months and 9.24 million jobs\\nare created.\\nThe seasoned investor realizes that stock prices may drop in anticipation of a\\nrecession, or because Wall Street is worried about inflation, but there’s no sense\\nin trying to anticipate either predicament, because the economic climate is\\nunpredictable. You have to have faith that inflation will cool down eventually,\\nand that recessions will thaw out.\\nThe Bulls and the Bears', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='In a normal day of trading, many stocks will go up in price, while others will go\\ndown. But occasionally there’s a stampede when the prices of thousands of\\nstocks are running in the same direction, like bulls at Pamplona. If the stampede\\nis uphill, we call it a “bull market.”\\nWhen the bulls are having their run, sometimes nine out of ten stocks are\\nhitting new highs every week. People are rushing around buying as many shares\\nas they can afford. They talk to their brokers more often than they talk to their\\nbest friends. Nobody wants to miss out on a good thing.\\nAs long as the good thing lasts, millions of shareholders go to bed happy, and\\nwake up happy. They sing in the shower, whistle while they work, help old\\nladies across the street, and count their blessings every night as they put\\nthemselves to sleep reviewing the gains in their portfolios.\\nBut a bull market doesn’t last forever. Sooner or later, the stampede will turn\\ndownhill. Stock prices will drop, with nine out of ten stocks hitting new lows\\nevery week.

When stock prices fall 25 percent or more, it’s called a “bear\\nmarket.” Of the fifty-three corrections, fifteen have turned into bear markets.\\nThat’s one every six years, on average.\\nNobody knows who coined the term “bear market,” but having their name\\nlinked to financial losses is unfair to bears. There are no bears within fifty miles\\nof Wall Street, unless you count the bears in the New York zoos, and bears do\\nnot dive off peaks the way stocks do in a bear market. You can make a better\\ncase for calling a bear market a lemming market, in honor of the investors who\\nsell their stocks because everybody else is selling.\\nThe Papa Bear market began in 1929, as we’ve already discussed. In the\\nMomma Bear market of 1973–74, the average stock was down 50 percent. There\\nwas another bear in 1982, followed by the Crash of 1987, when the Dow\\ndropped over one thousand points in four months, and 508 of those points in a\\nsingle day. There was the Saddam Hussein bear of 1990, when investors worried\\nabout the Gulf War. But these recent bears were easier to handle than the big\\nbears of 1929 and 1973–74.\\nAn extended bear market can test everybody’s patience and unsettle the most\\nexperienced investors.

Imagine\\nyour stocks being in the red for a quarter-century! From the high point in 1969\\nbefore the crash of 1973–74, it took twelve years to break even.

In fifty years of owning stocks, you can expect twenty-\\nfive corrections, of which eight or nine will turn into bears.\\nIt would be nice to be able to get a warning signal, so you could sell your\\nstocks and your mutual funds just before a bear market and then scoop them up\\nlater on the cheap. The trouble is, nobody has figured out a way to predict bear\\nmarkets. The record on that is no better than the record on predicting recessions.\\nOnce in a while, somebody calls a bear and becomes a celebrity overnight—a\\nstock analyst named Elaine Garzarelli was celebrated for predicting the Crash of\\n1987.

Far more money has been\\nlost by investors trying to anticipate corrections than has been lost in all the\\ncorrections combined.\\nOne of the worst mistakes you can make is to switch into and out of stocks or\\nstock mutual funds, hoping to avoid the upcoming correction. It’s also a mistake\\nto sit on your cash and wait for the upcoming correction before you invest in\\nstocks. In trying to time the market to sidestep the bears, people often miss out\\non the chance to run with the bulls.\\nA review of the S&P 500 going back to 1954 shows how expensive it is to be\\nout of stocks during the short stretches when they make their biggest jumps. If', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='you kept all your money in stocks throughout these four decades, your annual\\nreturn on investment was 11.5 percent.

Here’s another telling\\nstatistic.

Pemberton went to Atlanta from Columbus,\\nGeorgia, in 1869 and went into the patent medicine business as soon as he was\\nold enough to wow an audience.\\nThis was before we had truth in advertising and a Food and Drug\\nAdministration to watch over products that people ate or drank. So there was', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='nothing to stop Pemberton from mixing a bunch of ingredients (the main one\\nbeing alcohol) in the family bathtub, scooping the potion into bottles, and selling\\nit as a miracle cure, which is what patent medicine was all about.\\nPemberton’s product line included Indian Queen Hair Dye, Gingerine,\\nTriplex Liver Pills, and an exotic concoction made of sugar, water, extract of\\ncoca leaf, kola nut, and caffeine. The label said it was a “brain tonic and a cure\\nfor all nervous afflictions,” and in his sales pitches, Pemberton claimed it could\\ncure headaches, hysteria, and melancholy, and put the customer in a very fine\\nmood. This was the original Coca-Cola.\\nPemberton spent $73.96 on advertising in the first year, but he sold only fifty\\ndollars’ worth of Coke syrup, so consumers weren’t exactly buying his story.\\nFive years later, they still weren’t buying it, and Pemberton was tired of trying to\\nconvince them. So he sold the recipe, the equipment, the coca leaves, and the\\nkola nuts to an Atlanta druggist, Asa Candler. Candler paid twenty-three hundred\\ndollars for the whole shebang.\\nCandler was a religious man who preferred telling the truth to stretching it the\\nway Pemberton had. He took the coca leaves out of the recipe, so by 1905, Coca-\\nCola was entirely cocaine-free. It’s a good thing he did, because otherwise\\npeople could have gone to jail for sipping Coke after cocaine became illegal in\\n1914. The revamped Coke recipe is the best-kept secret of the century, still\\nguarded in the vaults of the Trust Company of Georgia.\\nHe also changed the label, leaving out the part about Coke being a “brain\\ntonic,” a “cure for nervous afflictions,” and other dubious claims. In 1916, he\\ninvented the curvy bottle that most of the world’s population can identify right\\naway as a Coke.\\nIn Candler’s factory, the kola nuts, sugar, water, caffeine—plus a few secret\\ningredients of his own—were boiled in giant kettles and stirred with giant\\nwooden paddles until they thickened into a syrup. The syrup was sent out to\\ndrugstores, where druggists added soda water for the fizz and served Cokes to\\npeople sitting at the counters. Drinking Coke got so popular that druggists had to\\nhire helpers, called “soda jerks,” to pour the syrup and apply the fizz. That’s how\\nthousands of teenagers across the country got their spending money—working\\nafter school pouring Cokes.\\nIn 1916, Congress slapped a new tax on businesses, and Candler was furious.\\nTo avoid paying higher taxes on his Coke profits, he sold the company for $25\\nmillion to an Atlanta banker, Ernest Woodruff. His son, Robert, became Coca-\\nCola’s president.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='Soon after they bought the company, the Woodruffs went public with it. In\\n1919, they sold 1 million shares for forty dollars apiece. This was a stock a lot of\\npeople wished they didn’t own, especially after the cost of syrup went through\\nthe roof. Angry bottlers protested the price hikes and threatened to cancel their\\ncontracts with the company. Lawsuits were filed. Coke’s sales went down, and\\nthe company wobbled on the edge of bankruptcy.\\nThanks to Robert Woodruff’s serious cost-cutting, Coke managed to survive\\nlong enough to reach the Great Depression. This was a terrible time for most\\ncompanies, but a good time for Coke. Even though people had very little money\\nto spend, and went without new shoes, new clothes, and so on, they kept buying\\nCokes.\\nHere’s a useful piece of advice for investors: Act like a bloodhound and\\nignore everything except the evidence that shows up in front of your nose. The\\neconomy in the 1930s couldn’t have been worse, but since Coke was very\\nprofitable, the stock price rose from $20 in 1932 to $160 in 1937.

He opened his wallet to the Atlanta Art Center Alliance, even though he\\nnever liked going to museums and symphonies. Many of his gifts were\\nanonymous, but people figured out Woodruff was responsible—who else in\\nAtlanta was that rich and that bighearted?

Besides soap, the company also made\\nbaking powder, and to sell the baking powder they gave away free cookbooks as\\na prize. The baking powder got so popular they decided to forget about the soap.\\nAt some point, they stopped giving away cookbooks and offered chewing\\ngum as a prize. The chewing gum got so popular they dropped the baking\\npowder and began to sell gum.\\nWrigley’s spearmint made its debut in 1893, but like Coke, it wasn’t an\\ninstant hit. However, by 1910, it was America’s favorite brand. In 1915, to boost\\nsales even further, Wrigley sent a free sample to every person listed in all the\\nphone books in the United States.\\nCampbell’s Soup\\nDr. John T. Dorrance, a chemistry buff, turned down offers of a professorship at\\nfour different universities to take a job at a soup company owned by his uncle,\\nArthur Dorrance, and by Joseph Campbell. Once installed there, Dr. Dorrance\\ninvented a process for making condensed soup, then bought out his uncle to\\nbecome sole owner of the business. This was a mistake on his uncle’s part,\\nbecause Campbell’s continued to grow its earnings and became the $11.4 billion\\ncompany it is today.\\nAn enthusiastic stockpicker in his spare time, Dr. Dorrance took his broker’s\\nadvice and sold all his stocks before the Crash of 1929. This was the best advice\\never given by a broker, before or since.\\nLevi’s\\nLevi Strauss was an immigrant from a part of Germany known as Bavaria.

While most of the prospectors\\nwent home empty-handed, Strauss got rich on his blue jeans. He took out a', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='patent on the denim version in 1873.\\nStrauss’s company was private until 1971, when it sold shares to the public,\\nthen bought back the shares and in 1985 went private again.\\nLevi’s, Campbell’s soup, Wrigley’s gum, and Coca-Cola got started one hundred\\nor more years ago, when life wasn’t as complicated as it is today and there\\nweren’t so many lawyers getting in the way of progress. But that doesn’t mean\\nyou can’t start a great business from scratch in the modern era. Ben and Jerry,\\nBill Gates, and Bernard Marcus have done it with ice cream, software, and\\nhardware stores.\\nHow Ben & Jerry’s Got Started\\nBen Cohen and Jerry Greenfield met in seventh-grade gym class on Long Island,\\nand a few years later, they became hippies. Ben dropped out of college, then\\ndrove a taxi, flipped hamburgers, mopped floors, guarded a racetrack, and took\\nup pottery. He once lived in a cabin in the Adirondacks with a woodstove and no\\nplumbing. He had a big beard and a belly to match.\\nMeanwhile, Jerry went to Oberlin College in Ohio, where in addition to his\\nregular studies he learned parlor tricks and how to run carnival games. He\\napplied to medical school, got rejected, then took a job stuffing beef hearts into\\ntest tubes. He was skinnier than Ben, and he adopted the grunge look long before\\nit was fashionable.\\nThe two of them crossed paths again in Saratoga Springs, New York, and\\ndecided since they had nothing better to do, why not start an ice cream\\nrestaurant? Jerry spent five dollars for a mail-order course on how to make the\\nice cream. With six thousand dollars they’d saved, plus two thousand dollars\\nthey borrowed from Ben’s father, they patched the roof of an old gas station in\\nBurlington, Vermont, threw a coat of paint on the walls, and renamed it the\\nScoop Shop. That was 1978.\\nThe people who came to the Scoop Shop couldn’t get enough of Ben and\\nJerry’s scoops. Their ice cream was rich and creamy, and full of big chunks of\\nfruit, or chocolate, or whatever they put into it. It was high-fat and high-\\ncholesterol, but in 1978, people didn’t care about cholesterol, so they could eat\\nlarge quantities of Ben & Jerry’s without feeling guilty.\\nSoon enough, Ben and Jerry were selling so much ice cream they outgrew the\\ngas station. They decided to build an ice cream factory. They could have gone to', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='venture capitalists to get the money, but instead, they went straight to the stock\\nmarket. In 1984, they sold 73,500 shares of stock at $10.50 apiece and raised\\nroughly three quarters of a million dollars. This was peanuts as far as big\\nbusiness went, but that’s all they needed for the factory.\\nTo make sure the company was locally owned, they made it a rule that only\\nresidents of Vermont could buy shares in the initial offering. Vermont is not a\\nwealthy state to begin with, so many investors bought one share apiece—this\\nwas all they could afford. Ten years later, the stock was worth ten times the\\noriginal price.\\nBen & Jerry’s is one of the most interesting public companies on record. The\\nbosses came to work in tee shirts and bib overalls and never wore suits—they\\ndidn’t own any suits. They named one of their flavors Cherry Garcia, in honor of\\nJerry Garcia, the rock star of the Grateful Dead. At the annual meetings, Ben\\nwould lie down with a brick on his belly and let Jerry smash the brick with a\\nsledgehammer.\\nYou couldn’t tell the executives from the mop-up crew. The parking lot was\\nfull of dented Volkswagens. The higher-ups were paid low salaries by normal\\nstandards—the idea was that everybody deserved to make a living, but nobody\\ndeserved to make a killing. The narrow salary gap made for friendlier relations\\nbetween labor and management, and better parties on the weekends.\\nBen and Jerry piped rock and roll into the plant, to inspire the staff to dance\\naround and do its best. They showed free outdoor movies in Burlington during\\nthe summer. They bought so much milk from local farmers that they revived the\\nentire Vermont dairy industry. They even paid extra for the milk, to help out the\\nfarmers. And 7.5 percent of the annual profits went to charity.\\nWhere else but in America could two hippies invest five dollars in a mail-\\norder course and end up as the third-largest ice cream manufacturers in the\\ncountry? A couple of years ago, the company had its midlife crisis: People had\\ndiscovered cholesterol, and they stopped eating so much of the rich, creamy ice\\ncream that was Ben & Jerry’s claim to fame.\\nThe company has changed with the times, and now it puts out a line of yogurt\\nand low-fat substitutes for the creamy stuff their customers once craved.\\nIn 1994, Ben stepped down as chief executive officer, although he was never\\nas much a chief executive as he was a chief ice cream taster. The company had a\\ncontest to find Ben’s replacement. To win the job, you had to send in something\\ninteresting, besides the usual résumé. The man who got the job wrote a poem.', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='Microsoft\\nBill Gates is William Henry Gates III, born in 1955. He grew up in the suburbs\\nof Bellevue, Washington, and attended the nearby Lakeside School. Lakeside\\nhad a computer lab, which was very unusual in the 1960s, and Gates took full\\nadvantage of it.\\nGates was entranced, captivated, smitten with computers. He spent as much\\ntime as possible in the lab with his friend and sidekick Paul Allen, who was a\\ncouple of years ahead of him in school. Computers got to be such an obsession\\nwith Gates that his parents issued an order: Give them up for a while.\\nReluctantly, Gates complied, but this absence only made his heart grow fonder.\\nSoon enough, Gates and Allen were up to their old tricks, experimenting with\\nthe primitive hardware and software that existed then. There were no instruction\\nmanuals or DOS for Dummies books to guide them—Gates and Allen invented\\nDOS. They were the pioneers of software, while hundreds of miles to the south,\\nthe two Steves, Jobs and Wozniak, were creating the Apple.\\nScientists and engineers in fancy research labs couldn’t accomplish what\\nthese young “hackers” in blue jeans and tee shirts accomplished by themselves.\\nBefore they left high school, Gates and Allen had become experts in the exciting\\nnew field of computer programming.\\nGates went on to Harvard, thinking he would become a lawyer, while Allen\\ngot a job with a small computer company in New Mexico, called MITS.\\nDividing his time between the classroom, the poker table, and the computer\\nroom, Gates was soon bored with college life. When he couldn’t stand it any\\nlonger, he dropped out of Harvard to join his old friend in New Mexico. The two\\nof them had already invented a new computer language called BASIC.\\nMITS had hired Allen to create a version of BASIC for a computer chip made\\nby Intel. But BASIC made such a big splash that several other computer makers\\nwanted to use it as the operating system for their machines. This led to a nasty\\nlawsuit over who had the rights to BASIC: Gates and Allen, or MITS? The\\ncourts ruled in favor of the inventors, because they’d developed BASIC before\\nthey got to MITS. Now, they were free to sell the language and keep the profits\\nfor themselves.\\nGates started his own company, Microsoft, even before he escaped the\\nclutches of MITS. After the lawsuit was resolved, he put all his energy into\\nMicrosoft. The company was informal and disorganized, and the employees\\nworked crazy hours. Computers were scattered around the office, but the books', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='were kept by hand. Visitors would peek into the boss’s office and ask: “Who’s\\nthat kid sitting at Mr. Gates’s desk?” That kid was Gates himself. He was\\ntwenty-five, and he looked even younger.\\nOne triumph led to another, and in 1980, this tiny company found itself in\\nserious negotiations with the computer giant IBM. IBM had developed a new\\nline of personal computers, and it needed a software system to go with it. Gates\\nwent to a meeting, impressed the IBM executives, and got the assignment of a\\nlifetime. Working day and night and in secrecy, under contract with IBM, Gates\\nand his cohorts created MS-DOS.\\nPeople have tried and failed to create a universal language for humans, but\\nMicrosoft has come close to doing it for computers—MS-DOS is currently\\nspoken by 75 percent of the personal computers on the planet.\\nIf IBM had been smart enough to demand some of the rights to MS-DOS, its\\nshares would be selling for a much higher price. Instead, IBM let Microsoft\\nretain all the rights, which is why Microsoft has become a billion-dollar\\ncompany in its own right. The moral to this story is: If you are about to make\\nsomebody very rich, insist on a piece of the action.\\nHome Depot\\nHome Depot got its start when three executives at the Handy Dan Home Center\\nstores got the boot. Convinced they could do a better job than the people who\\nfired them, this trio of rejects decided to open their own version of Handy Dan.\\nHandy Dan has disappeared from the scene, but Home Depot is everywhere.\\nThis decision was only a prelude to serious business for the organizers of\\nHome Depot. They convinced a venture capital group to put up the money to\\nbuild the first super hardware store, in Atlanta. The grand opening was a flop.\\nThe ad promised a free dollar to every person who walked through the door. The\\ncrowd was so small that at the end of the day, there was a pile of cash left over.\\nAt that point, people wouldn’t go to Home Depot even if you paid them.\\nBut it wasn’t long before customers were flocking to Home Depot, attracted\\nby the huge selection of merchandise, the low prices, and the well-trained clerks\\nwho could answer questions about everything from floorboards to floodlights. It\\nwas such a popular store that it continued to ring up sales in a recession, when\\nmost retailers were hurting. In fact, when the recession forced J. C.

It had made the common mistake of trying to expand too\\nfast. In 1986, it sold more stock and used the proceeds to pay some of its debts.\\nThree years later, it became the largest home-repair chain in the country.

We’re number one in music, television, and\\nmovies; the low-cost producers in forest products, paper, aluminum, and\\nchemicals. Wall Street is still the financial capital for stocks, and we’re gaining\\nback our prominence in banking, as the Japanese banks are beset with problems.\\nBelieve it or not, our railroads are so good at moving cargo that other\\ncountries are studying how we do it. Our freight system is the envy of freight\\nhaulers everywhere. (Our passenger system leaves a lot to be desired.) We’re\\ntops in cellular phones, electronic test equipment, pharmaceuticals,\\ntelecommunications, and farm equipment. We excel at genetic engineering,\\nsemiconductors, and medical advances. After years of decline, our share of the\\nexport market is rising. That means that consumers in other countries are buying\\nmore of what we make.\\nWe ship steel to Seoul, transistors to Tokyo, cars to Cologne, Spandex to\\nSiena, and bike parts to Bombay. Men on six continents shave their whiskers\\nwith Gillette. The skies are filled with Boeing’s aircraft. Japan is supposed to be\\nthe master of electronics—memory chips, TVs, and fax machines—but the\\nJapanese can’t keep up with the brainstorms coming out of such U.S. companies\\nas Intel, Micron Technology, Microsoft, and Compaq Computer.\\nWe’re number one in personal computers. In software, work stations, laser\\nprinters, computer networks, and microprocessors, we dominate the field.\\nMany of our most fantastic innovations emerge from small companies. We\\nlead the world in small companies as well. We’ve already seen how a bunch of', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='kids at Microsoft and Apple Computer changed the computer industry forever.\\nTwenty years later, there is a bunch of kids in software labs giving a repeat\\nperformance.\\nIt wasn’t long ago that we were scolded by our own newspapers and news\\nmagazines for being fat, lazy, and overpaid. We have a free press and the press\\nlikes to focus on warts and not halos, because warts sell more papers than halos\\ndo.\\nSo we heard over and over that the Japanese people worked harder than we\\ndid and the German people worked harder than we did, and while we were\\nsitting around channel surfing or goofing off in school or playing with Frisbees\\n(another great American invention), these other countries would be passing us\\nby.\\nIt was inevitable, the doomsayers said, that America would become a land of\\ndo-nothings and make-nothings, except maybe we’d still be smart enough to\\nmake those little paper umbrellas they stick into cocktails.\\nThe auto industry was the most obvious trouble spot. Before the 1960s, we\\nwere first in war, first in peace, and first in cars, and Detroit was the car lover’s\\nMecca. But after that, our auto companies got sloppy and let the factories run\\ndown. Through their powerful unions, the workers demanded higher and higher\\nwages. At this point, the Japanese and the Germans attacked Detroit with their\\nspiffy, well-made, low-priced cars. Millions of U.S. consumers preferred these\\nforeign models to the humdrum, poorly made, overpriced American cars.\\nJournalists and academics wrote articles and books about the decline and fall\\nof U.S. autos, which they saw as a symptom of the decline and fall of the\\nAmerican way of life. The most influential of these books was David\\nHalberstam’s The Reckoning.\\nYou could read Halberstam’s work and weep for the future of Ford, of\\nGeneral Motors, of Chrysler, and of America, but the year it was published,\\n1986, was also the year that Chrysler began its comeback from near bankruptcy\\nand Ford started on a huge rebound, while Nissan and the Japanese automakers\\nwere starting to flop. The U.S. losers have become winners again.\\nInvestors who did their homework and saw this happening got very wealthy\\nbuying Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors stock. If they bought at the right\\ntime, they made fifteen times their money in Chrysler, ten times in Ford, and\\nthree times in General Motors.\\nThis wasn’t a one-year improvement, or five years, it was a gigantic long-\\nterm trend. Just as it took years for Detroit to lose its place at the top of the auto', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='industry, it took years for the comeback. This comeback totally surprised a lot of\\npeople, but that’s because we weren’t getting the real story. We were hearing the\\nold news, about how the auto industry was controlled by the Japanese. But it\\nwasn’t the Japanese who invented the minivan; it was Chrysler. It wasn’t the\\nJapanese who put a new generation of snazzy, low-cost automobiles on the road;\\nit was Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors. It wasn’t Nissan that redesigned the\\nJeep; it was Chrysler. It wasn’t the Toyota that became the best-selling car in\\nEurope, it was the Ford Fiesta.\\nHere at home, the Japanese have been losing their share of the U.S. market, as\\nthe U.S. auto companies are winning it back.\\nWe’ve fixed up our factories and made them more efficient. Our wages have\\ncome down, and that has lowered our production costs, so we can sell our goods\\nat lower prices and undercut the foreign competition.\\nOver the last two decades that we’ve been feeling bad about ourselves, the\\nU.S. labor force has become the most productive in the world. Today, the\\nAmerican industrial worker produces $49,600 worth of goods every year, $5,000\\nmore than the average German and $10,000 more than the average Japanese.\\nWe’re putting in more hours and taking fewer vacations than the average\\nGerman worker, who gets five weeks of paid leave every year.\\nIn fact, the U.S. labor force has been so busy and so productive that a\\nprofessor at Harvard, Juliet Schor, has written a book called The Overworked\\nAmerican. The press did such a good job convincing us we’ve been goofing off,\\nespecially in comparison to the industrious Japanese, that it’s a surprise to\\ndiscover we’ve been working too hard.\\nThat’s not to say we don’t have our problems. In the last two decades, our\\neconomic growth overall has lagged behind the growth rates of prior decades,\\nand wages in the lowest-paying jobs haven’t risen much, if at all. We’ve got high\\ncrime and high unemployment in the inner cities, where as many as half the\\nchildren never finish high school. Without an education, these people can’t\\npossibly compete for all the wonderful jobs that have been created by computers\\nand advanced technology.\\nAs bad as our problems may be, they don’t add up to the pessimism that\\ninfects us. We got a similar dose of pessimism in the late 1940s, after the war\\nwas over and 10 million to 20 million Americans lost their war-related jobs in\\nthe military or the defense industries. More than a third of the workforce had to\\nfind work elsewhere, a crisis that far exceeded any layoff crisis we face today,\\nand yet today’s headlines would make you think we’re in worse shape now than', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='what we were in after World War II.\\nIn fact, the 1950s was a good decade for the economy and a great one for\\nstocks—second only to the 1980s in this century.

But we never debate whether Sam Walton is a villain or a\\nhero. Sam Walton got rich by starting Wal-Mart: Was this a good thing or a bad\\nthing? What about Michael Eisner at Disney? Is Eisner a rich pig or a corporate\\nsavior?\\nJoe Montana, who played football, is a national celebrity who is nearly\\ndeified for his great contribution to society. No doubt he has contributed. But\\nhow does Montana stack up as a hero against Sam Walton or Lee Iacocca at\\nChrysler? Who, for instance, has created more jobs?\\nIacocca never brought an NFL team back from a two-touchdown deficit in the\\nfourth quarter, the way Joe Montana did. But he brought back Chrysler, which\\nwas about to go out of business during the crucial quarters in 1981–82. The\\ngame was on the line—imagine what would have happened if Iacocca had failed.\\nNot only would Chrysler’s more than 115,948 workers have been sent home\\nfor good, but the tire makers, aluminum and steel suppliers, auto glass suppliers,\\nseat leather suppliers, and so forth, would have been forced to lay off workers in\\nthe wake of Chrysler’s demise. By saving Chrysler, Iacocca may have saved\\nmore than three hundred thousand paychecks. How many paychecks did Joe\\nMontana save?\\nBy putting fans in the seats, Montana indirectly kept some ticket sellers and\\nhot-dog vendors in business, and there’s nothing wrong with that. But the jobs\\nIacocca saved weren’t of the hot-dog vendor variety. Many of them were high-\\nskilled positions, paying twenty dollars an hour. Over three hundred thousand\\nwell-paid workers can thank Iacocca for their vacations, for their second homes,\\nand for helping to put their kids through college.\\nIs Jack Welch, the head of General Electric, a more important person than\\nElton John?

Only one woman makes the list—Doris Fisher, cofounder of The Gap.\\nWe can only hope that as more young people are attracted to careers in business,\\nwomen and minorities will get their chance to run public companies.\\nPerhaps after reading this book (it’s a family assignment) the three Lynch\\ndaughters, Mary, Annie, and Beth, and the two Rothchild daughters, Berns and\\nSascha, will be inspired to join the corporate ranks.\\nThe corporate leaders of America aren’t just a gang of moneygrubbers whose\\nmain purpose in life is to ride on Learjets to the golf courses of the world. Fred\\nSmith didn’t start Federal Express, also known as FedEx, because he needed the\\nmoney; Smith was already rich. He did it for the challenge, to create a mail\\nsystem that works better than the post office. Because Smith succeeded, the post\\noffice has shaped up considerably. Now, in addition to delivering mail in the\\nrain, hail, sleet, and snow, the postal service can even deliver it overnight.\\nBecause they end up with big bucks, the people who run companies are often\\nmade out to be villains, lumped together with bank robbers and con artists.\\nYou’d think they wrote themselves $10-million paychecks and left town with the\\nloot, when in fact, their money doesn’t come from their paychecks. This is a\\nmajor point that is overlooked by the jeering section.\\nIn most cases, the big corporate fortunes come from owning the company’s\\nstock. The higher up you are on the corporate ladder, the more likely it is that\\nyou will be paid in shares instead of cash. Executives are also given “options,”\\nwhich enable them to buy more shares at a specific price.\\nBut all of this works to the executives’ benefit only if the company does well\\nand the stock price goes up. If the company does poorly and the price goes\\ndown, these people stand to lose money and may be worse off than if they\\nearned a huge salary.\\nBeing paid in stock puts a company’s leadership on the same side of the table\\nas the shareholders. When they make big bucks on the stock, other investors also', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='are profiting from the shares they own. It’s a win/win situation.\\nSo instead of booing when Michael Eisner makes $50 million on his Disney\\nshares, we ought to be cheering him on, because it means that Disney is thriving\\nunder his leadership, the stock price is rising (up elevenfold in ten years), and\\ninvestors large and small are reaping the benefits.\\nThat said, we’d be willing to bet that Eisner isn’t just doing it for the money.\\nLike most of his colleagues at the CEO level, he’s already got plenty, yet he still\\ngoes to work every day. Why does he bother? He enjoys the challenge of\\noutsmarting the competition. Business demands savvy, strength, and cunning.\\nThere may be monotony on the assembly line, but not in the boardroom or the\\noffices upstairs.\\nIn teaching the post office a lesson, Fred Smith created jobs. All the corporate\\nheroes honored in this chapter have created jobs, not that we’ve been hearing\\nmuch about job creation. Lately, we’ve only been hearing about job losses.\\nFrom the news reports of the last couple of years, you’d think there weren’t\\nany jobs left in America. Every time you pick up a paper, you see another\\nheadline about a big corporate layoff. A reporter doesn’t have to dig very far to\\nfind one of these stories, because the largest five hundred companies in the\\nUnited States reduced their workforce by 3 million workers in the 1980s, and\\nthey’re on a pace to do the same in the 1990s.\\nA layoff is always painful to the person who loses the job, but that doesn’t\\nmake layoffs a national crisis. In the larger scheme of things, these layoffs are\\nhealthy.\\nCompanies aren’t Scrooges who wring their hands in glee and shout “Bah\\nHumbug” as they shove loyal employees out the door. In many cases, the layoffs\\nare done by attrition: A person who is about to retire isn’t replaced. But the\\nlayoffs have a purpose: to make companies more competitive and better able to\\nsurvive in the future.\\nImagine the catastrophe we’d be facing if those five hundred big companies\\nhad kept the 3 million workers they dismissed in the 1980s. Eventually, the\\nbloated payrolls would have destroyed these companies. They couldn’t possibly\\nhave been able to compete against their more efficient rivals, which could\\noperate at lower cost and drive them out of business. So instead of the 3 million\\njobs lost in the big companies, we might have lost 10 million, or 15 million, and\\nthe country would have been thrown into another Depression.\\nThat brings us to the twenty-five large companies listed on page 228. There\\nare at least three kinds: companies that have kept growing for decades', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='(Walgreen, McDonald’s, and Raytheon, for instance); companies that had lost\\ntheir way before the hero arrived to turn them around; and companies that were\\ndoing OK but then got a second wind and accomplished amazing things, given\\nthat they were getting old and people thought their best years were behind them.\\nChrysler is one of the turnarounds, along with Colgate, Allied Signal,\\nCaterpillar, Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage), and Citicorp, so we’ve got\\nseveral different kinds of companies represented here. Then in the “second-\\nwind” category, we’ve got Coca-Cola, which has done the improbable and\\naccelerated its growth rate along with Gillette, Motorola, and Merck.\\nThere are two heroes of the Fannie Mae story, David Maxwell and Jim\\nJohnson. Fannie Mae, formally known as the Federal National Mortgage\\nAssociation, is the country’s number-one owner and packager of home\\nmortgages. When David Maxwell came along, Fannie Mae was an unstable\\nenterprise—one year in the black, the next in the red, flirting with insolvency.\\nMaxwell straightened Fannie Mae out and put it squarely in the black.\\nJohnson took over in 1991. Under his direction, Fannie Mae has more than\\ndoubled its earnings and made future earnings less volatile and more dependable.\\nWhile Fannie Mae employs only three thousand people, a tiny payroll for such a\\nbig company, it affects millions of homeowners directly and indirectly through\\nits ownership of one out of five mortgages in America.\\nThe fate of large numbers of jobs depends on Fannie Mae’s ability to finance\\nmortgage loans. If this company were poorly managed and got into trouble, we\\nmight see a collapse of the new housing market as well as the resale market.\\nHome builders, carpet layers, real-estate agents, insurance agents, bankers,\\nappliance stores, hardware stores, and home-furnishings stores would suffer as a\\nresult.\\nHewlett-Packard was an old-line technology company that made testing\\nequipment and measuring equipment for the electronics industry. As you can see\\non the table on page 242, in 1975, it had $981 million in sales; twenty years\\nlater, it approaches $30 billion in sales. The testing and measuring part of the\\ncompany accounts for only 11 percent of the revenues. Seventy-eight percent\\ncomes from printers and computers. Hewlett-Packard didn’t make printers\\nfifteen years ago, but it has quietly become the Goliath in the business, selling an\\nestimated $9 billion to $10 billion worth of printers and related products every\\nyear. The printers have given Hewlett-Packard a quality brand name that helps it\\nsell computers. In now ranks sixth in personal computer sales worldwide.\\nHewlett-Packard has grown to nearly half the size of IBM, but in 1975, it was', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='fifteen times smaller. It grew and prospered because the employees were\\nencouraged to invent new products and to develop new ideas. The hero who\\naided and abetted this innovation is CEO John Young.\\nThis drive to make companies more competitive can be traced back to 1982.\\nWe’d just come through the worst recession since World War II—a tough\\nstretch. The auto industry was hopeless, we had high unemployment, and\\nAmericans from coast to coast sensed that the country was losing it.\\nIn this general crisis, corporate leaders made a momentous decision. They\\ndecided to change the basic way they approached business. Before 1982, they\\nhad stumbled through each economic cycle, adding workers during periods of\\nprosperity, then laying them off during recessions. When business was bad, they\\ncut back in stages, first eliminating the overtime, then giving older workers early\\nretirement, and so forth.\\nSince 1982, companies of all kinds have dedicated themselves to becoming\\nmore efficient overall. On Wall Street, this is known as restructuring, rightsizing,\\ndownsizing, or getting leaner and meaner. Whatever you call it, it means\\nreducing costs and boosting productivity, not just to survive recessions, but to\\nbecome more profitable and more competitive as a matter of course.\\nTake a company like Johnson & Johnson, with a record of thirty years of\\nnearly uninterrupted increased earnings—under the old system, it wouldn’t have\\noccurred to Johnson & Johnson to make rightsizing a priority. But under the new\\nsystem, even a healthy company like Johnson & Johnson realized it had to take\\nsteps to maintain its edge, while continuing to develop new products.\\nThat’s why we’ve seen this surge in corporate profitability in the last fifteen\\nyears, which has produced a surge in stock prices that tops any other period in\\nhistory. We’re a much wealthier nation than we were in 1982, and much of this\\nprosperity has to do with the change in the way companies do business,\\nincluding laying off workers to become more competitive. No one has noticed\\nthis out in medialand. They still think our corporate leaders are busy playing\\ngolf.\\nCompanies are no longer resting on their laurels. They might have record\\nearnings this year, but they are worried about what happens ten years out. They\\ndon’t want to go the way of Pan Am, Eastern, and Braniff—three airlines that\\nlost their edge and went out of business. Directly or indirectly, tens of thousands\\nof workers lost their jobs when these airlines disappeared.\\nBeing more competitive isn’t just a matter of handing out the pink slips and\\nturning off some lights to save money. Let’s say a company invests $100 million', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='to build a new plant, where the same workforce from the old plant can increase\\nthe output by 15 percent.\\nThis extra 15 percent can help a lot of people. The company can give its\\nemployees a 5 percent raise, making the workers happy; it can lower prices by 5\\npercent, making the customers happy; and it can increase its profits, making the\\nshareholders happy. Of course, this 15 percent could be divided up differently.\\nBut the point is there are multiple benefits when a company becomes more\\ncompetitive.\\nThere’s another way to increase productivity: making better products with\\nfewer mistakes. Fewer mistakes mean fewer complaints from customers, fewer\\nphone calls to apologize for those mistakes, fewer replacement items that have to\\nbe shipped out, fewer repairs of defective merchandise. A company that cuts\\ndown on its defects from 5 percent to 0.5 percent can save huge amounts of time\\nand money that otherwise would be expended on cleaning up messes and\\nhanding irate customers.\\nIn the table beginning on page 236, you’ll find the list of heroes that have\\nturned small companies into big companies. It’s another side of the job story that\\nrarely gets told. You’ve heard about the 3 million jobs lost from the big\\ncompanies in the 1980s—and more of the same in the 1990s—but have you\\nheard about the 21 million jobs created by small and medium-sized companies in\\nthe 1980s? There haven’t been many headlines about that.\\nNobody has an exact count of the jobs created by small companies, but we do\\nknow that 2.1 million new businesses opened their doors in the 1980s. Some are\\nbigger than others, some have succeeded and some have failed, but if we assume\\nthat on average, each small business employs ten people, that’s 21 million new\\njobs. That’s seven times more jobs than were lost in the well-publicized big\\nlayoffs.\\nAmong these 2.1 million businesses was a small group of high achievers that\\neventually went public. Twenty-five of the most successful have made it to our\\nheroes list. It’s amazing how far they’ve come in a short time. In 1985, the\\ntwenty-five added together had sales of $30.8 million, less than half of what\\nExxon sold by itself. IBM’s earnings in 1985 were four times the combined\\nearnings of all twenty-five.\\nBack then, these twenty-five companies provided jobs for 358,000 workers,\\nwhile the large companies on our list provided jobs for more than 2.6 million\\nworkers.\\nLook what’s happened in ten years. While the large companies on our list', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='have lost more than 420,000 jobs over that period, our small companies have\\nturned into giants. In 1995, their combined sales will be $225 billion, and they\\nemploy nearly 1.4 million workers, adding 1 million jobs to the workforce.\\nIn 1975, Disney qualified as a small company; today, it is huge. Walt Disney\\nis the superhero of the Disney story; Michael Eisner is the hero. Disney’s great\\norganization had begun to nod off a bit when Eisner prodded it awake. In the old\\ndays, Disney would reissue the classic animated films, but until Eisner came\\nalong, the company had stopping making new ones. Under Eisner’s regime, the\\ncompany brought out The Lion King, Aladdin, and Beauty and the Beast, among\\nothers; became a major producer of feature films; revitalized the existing theme\\nparks and opened new ones; triumphed in the music business with soundtracks\\nthat were as popular as its movies; and launched a merchandising campaign that\\nput Disney souvenirs in stores around the world.\\nToys R Us was a medium-sized enterprise in 1985, but today it has more sales\\nthan Gillette or Colgate and 20,000 more employees than Goodyear Tire. Wal-\\nMart was the biggest of the small companies in 1985, but today it is bigger than\\nevery one of the big companies on our list, except Exxon.\\nCorporate Heroes\\nCompany Name Corporate Heroes\\nAllied Signal Lawrence A.

Today, it manufactures two billion-dollar pharmaceuticals,\\nNeupogen and Epogen. These are important drugs that help patients\\nworldwide and could help Amgen earn more than $300 million in 1995.\\nThe heroes there are George B. Rathmann and Gordon Binder.\\nThen there’s Ross Perot’s creation, Electronic Data Systems, bought by\\nGeneral Motors in 1984. Perot used to work for IBM. He tried to talk IBM into\\nhelping companies solve their information-processing problems, but IBM wasn’t\\nparticularly interested. So Perot went off on his own and started EDS. It had\\n$100 million in sales in 1975, $3.4 billion in 1985, and in 1995, it will reach $10\\nbillion in sales. Perot has been out of EDS since 1986, but the company has\\ngrown dramatically since he left. It’s been a fantastic acquisition for GM.\\nThis shows you the importance of a hero. For at least a couple of decades,\\nIBM didn’t have heroic leadership. This dominant company was caught\\nflatfooted. It lost the information services business to Perot’s EDS, the software\\nbusiness to Microsoft, and the microprocessor business to Intel. It lost its\\nnumber-one ranking in personal computer sales to Compaq and a big chunk of\\nits mainframe memory business to EMC. All five of these successful competitors\\nto IBM are on our list of small companies that have made it big.\\nBill McGowan and Bert Roberts are the heroes at MCI. They dared to', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='compete with AT&T in the long-distance market while people laughed at them\\nfor doing it. For ten years, MCI lost money, but it has survived and it has\\nsucceeded. Because of MCI’s competition, we all pay less for long-distance\\ncalls.\\nKen Iverson is the hero at Nucor, a steel company in a hopeless industry.\\nIverson doesn’t waste money on trifles, so he put Nucor headquarters in a strip\\nmall in Darlington, South Carolina. (It remained there for years.) Nucor started\\nout as a buyer of steel, but soon learned to make its own high-quality steel from\\nscrap, something U.S. Steel never figured out how to do. By the year 2000\\nNucor will produce as much steel as U.S. Steel. It will have caught up to the first\\nbillion-dollar company in U.S. history.\\nTom Stemberg is the hero at Staples. He once wrote a business plan for an\\noffice superstore. Nobody paid much attention to it except Stemberg himself. He\\nput it into practice with the first superstore in Brighton, Massachusetts. That was\\njust about ten years ago. Today, office superstores are on the verge of becoming\\na $10-billion industry, and at the current growth rate, they will be a $20-billion\\nindustry by the year 2000.\\nA pair of brothers makes the heroes list. They left home in opposite\\ndirections. Jim Burke went the large-company route and ended up in the\\nchairman’s chair at Johnson & Johnson, while Dan Burke went the small-\\ncompany route and joined a tiny communications outfit that became the hugely\\nsuccessful Capital Cities/ABC, which recently agreed to a merger with Disney.\\nThe nation’s prosperity depends on small companies getting bigger and big\\ncompanies getting more competitive. If, while our twenty-five small companies\\nwere coming along, the twenty-five old-timers on our list had fallen apart, the\\nnet result would have been zero job growth, or possibly a huge loss in jobs.\\nImagine the disaster if dozens of the Fortune 500 companies had gone\\nbankrupt instead of downsizing and rightsizing. In that case, we might have lost\\n15 million jobs in the last decade, and today we’d have 20 percent\\nunemployment in spite of the 21 million jobs created by small companies\\nnationwide.\\nDon’t think it couldn’t have happened. It could have happened if companies\\nhad decided to keep every last worker and throw productivity out the window,\\nand to hang on until foreign rivals put them out of business. It could have\\nhappened if our heroes hadn’t come along to inspire their colleagues to a\\nmaximum effort.\\nIn the United States, we’re fortunate to have such an excellent mix of small', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='companies on the rise and large companies doing well. You won’t find this mix\\nin Europe, which suffers from a shortage of small companies. We have so many\\nsuccess stories to choose from that our list could have run several pages.\\nIt was difficult to narrow our list to twenty-five. Many other heroes at other\\ngreat companies were left out. We could easily have picked 250 small companies\\nthat hit the big time in the last twenty years, along with one hundred large\\ncompanies that kept going or turned themselves around.\\nWe also could have packed our list with all-stars of software, computing, and\\nelectronics (Cisco, Sun Microsystems, and Micron Technology) and the\\nperformance of our twenty-five small companies would look even better. But we\\ntried to get a sampling from different industries to show that companies of all\\nkinds can grow fast in America. We’ve included a toy company, a payroll\\nprocessor, an airline, even a company that makes the “carbon black” that’s used\\nto strengthen tires. That’s Cabot. Cabot went through a difficult period, but\\nturned itself around. It’s the only turnaround among the twenty-five.\\nThe heroes list gives you one more example of how you can make money\\ninvesting in big companies or in small companies, but if you specialize in small\\ncompanies, you could do amazingly well. Among our big companies there are\\nthree ten-baggers in which investors could have made ten times their money—\\nFannie Mae, Gillette, and Coca-Cola. In the 1985–95 period, among the small\\ncompanies, there are six ten-baggers, three twenty-five-baggers, and three forty-\\nto fifty-baggers. You’ve got Amgen up from $1.36 to $84, Oracle up from $0.83\\nto $42, and Compaq up from $1.69 to $50. Those are impressive moves.\\nYou can see why you don’t need to be right all the time to make money in\\nstocks. Let’s say you own ten small companies and three of them go from $40\\nmillion in sales to zero, and their stocks go from $20 a share to zero. These\\nlosses will be more than offset by one big winner that goes from $40 million in\\nsales to $800 million, sending its stock price soaring from $20 a share to $400 a\\nshare.\\nThe dynamic process of new companies’ going public continues at a heady\\npace. From 1993 through mid-1995, more than seventeen hundred new stocks\\nhave made their debut. Investors have risked $100 billion on these fledglings.\\nSome will be flops, but among these seventeen hundred you will find the next\\nAmgen, the next Staples, the next Home Depot.\\nCorporate Heroes', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='Company Name Corporate Heroes\\nAmgen George B.

Analysts at the brokerage\\nhouses were scurrying around, finding out everything they could,\\nbut this information rarely reached the client. If a brokerage house\\nchanged its recommendation from “buy” to “sell,” the small-time\\ncustomer was the last to know.\\nIf you asked for it, your broker might send you an analyst’s report on a\\ncompany, but these reports were often several months out of date. Amateur\\ninvestors had to rely on the quarterly and annual reports put out by companies\\nthemselves. They also made frequent trips to the local library, where they pored\\nover a publication called Value Line. Value Line gives a one-page rundown on\\nhundreds of companies and is packed with useful information—it’s an excellent\\nresource even today. Make use of it if you can—if you’ve got a stockbroker, you\\ncan probably get the Value Line reports from him or her.\\nIn the old days, your research was limited to Value Line; Standard & Poor’s\\nreports, which are similar to Value Line, but with less opinion; the occasional\\nanalyst’s report from the brokerage house; and the material that arrived directly\\nfrom companies. Computers have changed all this. There’s been an explosion in\\nfinancial data that’s available on computers. Every day, some new information\\nservice makes its debut—and many of these services are free.\\nComputers have made the stockbroker into a much more valuable resource.\\nInstead of mailing you an out-of-date analyst’s report or a page from Value Line,\\na broker can now pass along all the up-to-date information that shows up on his\\nmonitor: the latest word from the analysts, news flashes, the latest earnings\\nestimates for thousands of companies.\\nIf you have a home computer, you can get all this data on your own, without a\\nstockbroker.

No matter what the CEO says in the text\\nof an annual report, the numbers in the back of the report give you\\nthe complete, unvarnished account of the company’s behavior. If\\npicking stocks becomes your hobby, do yourself a favor and take an\\naccounting course.\\nTo help you decipher the numbers in the meantime, we’ve concocted a\\nsample of what you’ll find in the typical corporate financial report. It’s the five-\\nyear history of Compuspeak, an imaginary enterprise started by an imaginary\\ncharacter, Barclay.\\nBarclay is a research scientist from Silicon Valley. In his spare time, he has\\ndeveloped a new gadget called the Interface, which enables the user to issue\\nverbal commands—such as “turn on,” “turn off,” “switch windows,” or “copy to\\nfloppy”—to any personal computer. He’s gotten to the point that he’s producing\\nthe units in the makeshift laboratory/factory in his garage. He’s taken a second\\nmortgage on his house to pay the bills.\\nTo get the rest of the story, we move to the balance sheet, shown on page 261.\\nA balance sheet is a list of everything a company owns, as well as everything it\\nowes. It’s similar to a list of pluses and minuses you might make about your\\npersonality.\\nWe call it a balance sheet because the two sides are always kept in balance,\\nwith the pluses adding up to the same result as the minuses. Normally, a balance\\nsheet has a left side and a right side, but in our sample balance sheet, we’ve put\\none side on top of the other.\\nCompuspeak gets its start in life from the $100,000 Barclay borrowed from\\nthe bank against the value of his house—his second mortgage. He invests this', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='money in his fledgling company. On day one, it shows up on the plus side of the\\nbalance sheet under Current Assets in two places: $50,000 in Cash, and $50,000\\nin Gross Property, Plant, & Equipment. Barclay has spent $50,000 on equipment\\n—the machinery to make his gadgets. At this point, he has no factory, or Plant,\\nbecause he’s working out of his garage.\\nThis brings us to depreciation. Depreciation results from the fact that\\nfactories, offices, machinery, computers, desks, chairs, and so forth lose their\\nvalue as they get older. The Internal Revenue Service recognizes this and allows\\nbusinesses to deduct the lost value of equipment and buildings as they\\ndeteriorate or become outmoded.\\nRaw land can’t be depreciated, but the IRS has a formula for everything from\\ntape recorders to tanning beds. Buildings usually can be “written off” over\\ntwenty to twenty-five years; machinery, typewriters, computers, and so forth\\nhave a much shorter depreciation—three to fifteen years depending on the item\\nin question. That’s because they become obsolete faster than buildings do.\\nOn day one, you can see that there is no Less Accumulated Depreciation\\nunder Gross Property Plant & Equipment. That’s because Barclay hasn’t taken\\nany depreciation.\\nSo much for the pluses—the assets. Now we get to the bottom half, the\\nCurrent Liabilities. This is what the company owes. On day one, Compuspeak\\ndoesn’t owe anybody anything, because Barclay’s $100,000 bank loan is\\npersonal—he took out a mortgage on his house. The company’s liabilities are\\nzero.\\nBelow Current Liabilities, you find Equity. A company gets equity in two\\nways: by selling shares of its stock or by making money from its business. On\\nday one, Compuspeak hasn’t made any money in its business—notice the\\nRetained Earnings are zero—so its only equity is the $100,000 that Barclay\\ninvested in the company. That’s the Paid-in Capital.\\nBelow equity, you get to Liabilities & Shareholder Equity, which is the sum\\nof Total Liabilities, Paid-in Capital, and Retained Earnings. After that, you reach\\nShares Outstanding. When Barclay invested the original $100,000 in his\\ncompany, he issued himself 10,000 shares of stock, so each share would be\\nworth $10, as shown in the Book Value of $10 on day one. This was an arbitrary\\ndecision on Barclay’s part. He could just as easily have issued himself 1,000\\nshares worth $100 apiece.\\nNo matter whether it’s Barclay’s company or General Motors, the balance\\nsheet is set up the same way. You can see at a glance what the pluses are—the', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='cash, the inventories, and so forth—and what the minuses are.\\nBeyond day one, we see the balance sheet going forward. Let’s look at the\\nsituation at the end of year one, returning to the top of the balance sheet. Under\\nCurrent Assets, you see there’s only $25,000 in cash left in the company—\\nBarclay has spent the rest to run the business and to manufacture his product, the\\nInterface.\\nThen there’s Accounts Receivable of $19,500. This tells us that some of\\nBarclay’s customers have bought the Interface, but they haven’t gotten around to\\npaying the bills. The $19,500 is money owed to the company it hasn’t received\\nyet—hence Accounts Receivable. It’s the total amount that customers owe.\\nNext, we come to Inventories of $30,000. That means $30,000 worth of\\nInterfaces are sitting in Barclay’s garage waiting to be sold—along with the parts\\nto make more Interfaces. Unsold merchandise is counted as an asset, although\\nthere’s no guarantee Barclay will ever be able to sell these unsold Interfaces at\\nthe regular price.\\nDropping down to Gross Property Plant & Equipment, you notice the Less\\nAccumulated Depreciation figure of $10,000. Barclay has “written off” $10,000\\nworth of machinery. He spent $50,000 to acquire this equipment, but now he’s\\ncarrying it on the books at a value of $40,000. He will get a $10,000 deduction\\non his taxes for this depreciation. Because of the kind of machinery he has,\\nwhich is quickly outmoded, the IRS allows him to write off 20 percent of the\\nvalue each year. The $10,000 is 20 percent of the $50,000 expenditure that\\nshowed up earlier under Gross Property Plant & Equipment.\\nIn the Liabilities area, we find $10,000 in Accounts Payable. If Accounts\\nReceivable is money the people owe Barclay, Accounts Payable is money that\\nBarclay owes. It represents all the bills he hasn’t yet paid: telephone bills,\\nelectric bills, bills from his suppliers, and so forth.\\nBelow Liabilities, on the Equity line, you see the Retained Earnings: $4,500.\\nThat’s the bottom line—Barclay’s profit from one year in business. The\\ncompany now has equity of $104,500. This includes the $100,000 Barclay\\ninvested at the outset, plus the $4,500 the company earned in the first year.\\nBarclay had a choice of what to do with his profit. He could have put the\\n$4,500 into his own pocket by paying himself a dividend. But instead, he left it\\nin the company, so the extra money could be invested in the growth of the\\nbusiness. That’s why we say the earnings were “retained.”\\nThanks to the retained earnings plus his original $100,000 outlay, Barclay’s\\ncompany is valued at $104,500—the Equity at the end of year one. Since', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='Barclay issued himself 10,000 shares, each share is valued at $10.45 ($104,500\\ndivided by 10,000). This is called the company’s “equity per share” or its “book\\nvalue.”\\nGoing forward into year two and beyond, the numbers show how\\nCompuspeak has increased its business, selling more Interfaces while the\\naccounts receivable and the inventories continue to mount. In year two, another\\nelement is introduced on the minus side: $121,000 in Bank Debt. This time,\\nBarclay isn’t borrowing the money, the company is doing the borrowing.\\nCompuspeak needs these funds to pay for expansion: new machinery, more\\ninventory, new workers, and so forth.\\nDid you notice that bank debt doesn’t count as equity at the bottom of the\\nbalance sheet? When banks lend money to companies, the banks don’t become\\nowners. Neither do individuals who buy a company’s bonds. Barclay still owns\\nall 10,000 shares, and after two years of retained earnings, his equity has\\nincreased to $114,500.\\nCompuspeak has come a long way by the end of year five. The company has\\n$180,000 in cash, plus other Current Assets that add up to $744,500. Just below\\nCurrent Assets, in Gross Property Plant & Equipment, we discover that Barclay\\nhas increased his capital spending, because the gross value of his plant and\\nequipment has jumped from $120,000 at the end of year two to $500,000 at the\\nend of year five.\\nTo have spent this much, he must have left his garage, set up a small factory\\nsomeplace else, and installed fancy new machinery. As he buys more equipment,\\nhis depreciation rises accordingly.\\nDifferent kinds of companies require different levels of capital spending.\\nSteel mills, for instance, have huge expenses: It costs a lot of money to maintain\\nand to upgrade a steel plant. Oil wells require very little capital spending once\\nthe well is drilled and the oil is gushing out. Advertising agencies have almost no\\ncapital spending: All they need is an office and a bunch of desks.\\nBarclay has fewer capital improvements to pay for than the owner of a steel\\nmill, but relative to the rest of his budget, his capital spending is a big drain on\\nhis resources. That’s the nature of the high-tech hardware business he’s in.\\nDown in the Liabilities section, we find out that Barclay has paid off the bank\\ndebt, because at the end of year five, the debt is back to zero. Where did he get\\nthe money to do this, you wonder? You’ll find the answer under the Equity line.\\nPaid-in Capital has jumped from $100,000 to $700,000. Barclay must have\\nissued and sold some stock. Notice the change in Shares Outstanding? There', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='used to be 10,000 shares, all owned by Barclay. Now there are 15,000 shares.\\nAnother investor has been brought in! On the Paid-in Capital line you can\\nfollow his tracks. See the $700,000 figure? We know Barclay put in $100,000 to\\nbegin with, so this new investor has paid $600,000 for 5,000 newly issued shares\\nof Compuspeak stock. The new investor owns one-third of Barclay’s company.\\nThanks to this much-needed infusion of capital, the Equity per Share at the\\nend of year five has jumped to $59.63. Another way of saying this is that\\nCompuspeak now has a book value of $59.63 per share. That means Barclay’s\\nown 10,000 shares are worth $596,300. His original $100,000 investment and all\\nhis hard work are starting to pay off.\\nWhy is the mystery investor willing to risk $600,000, paying $120 a share for\\nBarclay’s company? Because he sees how well Barclay has done so far, and he\\nbelieves the growth in sales and profits will continue. That’s the promise of a\\nsmall company that’s more than doubling in size every year.\\nYou can track the earnings for yourself in the category marked Income per\\nShare on the Income Statement on page 262: $0.45 after year one, $1 after year\\ntwo, $6 after year five. The mystery investor has paid $120 per share for a\\ncompany that is earning $6 per share, based on the earnings from year five.\\nDividing the stock price ($120) by the earnings ($6), we get the\\nprice/earnings ratio: 20. The average stock on the New York Stock Exchange\\ntoday has a price/earnings ratio of 15 to 16, so the mystery investor is paying\\nslightly more for his stake in Compuspeak than investors in general are paying\\nfor publicly traded stocks. He’s doing this because he knows the potential of\\nfast-growing small companies. He knows its risky, but if all goes well, he figures\\nthere’s a chance that Compuspeak will eventually go public, the stock will\\nbecome a ten-, twenty-, or fifty-bagger, and he’ll make many times his money.\\nIf he had a choice, Barclay wouldn’t sell a third of his beloved Compuspeak.\\nHe’s doing it because he needs the money to expand the company, to cover the\\ncosts of maintaining the inventory, to carry the accounts receivable, and to pay\\nsalaries. His success has produced a cash crunch, and selling shares is the easiest\\nway to raise cash.\\nBy giving up a third of Compuspeak he insures its survival. He figures that\\nowning 67 percent of a well-funded enterprise is better than owning 100 percent\\nof a company that’s strapped for cash so it can’t realize its potential.\\nA few more years down the road, Barclay will reach the point where he needs\\nmore money. That may be a perfect time to go public. Until then, Barclay is\\nmaking a big sacrifice to chase his pot of gold. He has left his “real job” to', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='devote full time to his company, and he’s taking out a minimal salary, just\\nenough to cover basic living expenses. He’s borrowed money on his house to\\nmake his initial investment in the company, so his mortgage payments are higher\\nthan before. He’s too busy to take vacations and can’t really afford them.\\nBarclay’s wife is working overtime at her job so she can pay as many of the\\nhousehold bills as possible. The two of them are eating at home and avoiding\\nexpensive restaurants. Instead of buying a new car every four years, as they have\\nin the past, they are keeping the old ones. Their standard of living has declined\\nconsiderably, but they are both putting up with it. Barclay’s wife is as bullish on\\nCompuspeak as he is.\\nLet’s get back to the numbers. Once again, we turn to the Income Statement.\\nHere we get a breakdown of the operations inside the company: how much\\nmoney is being made and how it’s being spent. In year one, under Sales\\nRevenue, we see that Compuspeak sold $200,000 worth of Interfaces.\\nMeanwhile, the cash that was left in the company savings account earned $2,500\\nin interest. So Compuspeak’s total take from its first year in business was\\n$202,500. In the lingo of accounting, the total take is called “net revenues.”\\nJust below Net Revenues, we find out where most of the net revenues went.\\nThis is the Costs section. Here we get a rundown on the costs of materials and\\nmanufacturing labor, and also the selling, general, and administrative costs\\n(known as SG&A) of operating the business and promoting the product.\\nIn year one, you’ll also notice that Barclay spent $20,000 on research and\\ndevelopment. He was trying to improve the Interface so competitors would have\\na hard time knocking him off.\\nNot all companies are saddled with as many expenses as Compuspeak is. It’s\\nsomething to consider before you invest in any stock: Is this a capital-intensive\\nbusiness? Does it require huge outlays for a sales staff and research and\\ndevelopment? If so, a lot of money that might otherwise go into the investors’\\npockets will be lost to expenses.\\nIf you invest in a sand-and-gravel-pit company, the research and development\\ncosts will be zero, because the company won’t need to improve the sand and\\ngravel to keep up with technological advances. Also, the sales costs will be low,\\nbecause the company won’t need to hire a sophisticated sales force to market the\\nsand and gravel.\\nLikewise, in a company that owns a chain of hamburger joints, research and\\ndevelopment will be minimal because it’s hard to improve a hamburger, and the\\nsales force can be hired for minimum wage because selling a hamburger doesn’t', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='require an advanced degree.\\nBeing in his line of work, Barclay can’t get away with a cut-rate sales force.\\nHe needs a trained staff that understands the Interface and can explain it to\\ncorporate buyers and to computer stores that stock it for retail sale.\\nSome of Barclay’s capital expenditures and all of his research and\\ndevelopment expenditures are what we’d call “discretionary.” That means he\\ndidn’t have to spend this money. He wasn’t obligated to do research or to\\nupgrade his machinery.\\nThe head of any company has to decide how much to spend on capital\\nimprovements and on research, or whether the company can get along without\\nthese improvements. CEOs and other corporate managers have to make these\\njudgments all the time. If they skimp on research or they don’t upgrade their\\nfactory and machinery, they run the risk of being destroyed by a competitor who\\ncomes along with a better product, manufactured at a lower cost. On the other\\nhand, if they cut capital spending and research, their earnings will go up\\ndramatically in the short run.\\nIn most cases, higher earnings will boost the stock price, making the\\nshareholders happy. And with the money it didn’t spend on upgrades, the\\ncompany can declare a fat dividend, making the shareholders even happier. But\\nif the company loses its edge and a competitor steals the business, this happiness\\nwill be short-lived. The company’s sales will drop, its earnings will drop, and the\\nstock price will decline. Soon, it will be too broke to pay a dividend.\\nBy eliminating his research and his capital spending, Barclay could have\\ntaken the easy route, awarding himself a tremendous dividend. By boosting his\\nshort-term earnings, he could have made the company more profitable to attract\\na buyer for the rest of his shares. He could have sold out and headed for the golf\\ncourse.\\nBut like many of the heroes you read about in Chapter Four, Barclay has\\nresisted the temptation to take money out of his company. He’s keeping up his\\ncapital spending and his research, because he believes in the future of the\\ncompany. Someday, when Compuspeak becomes a $100-million business, he\\ncan sell his shares and buy two golf courses and a Learjet. But he probably\\nwon’t. He’ll be too busy figuring out how to make Compuspeak into a $200-\\nmillion business.\\nBelow Research & Development Expense, we come across our old friend\\nDepreciation. In year one, as we’ve already mentioned, Barclay was able to\\nclaim $10,000 in depreciation. This shows up as a cost, as it should. Soon', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='enough, his equipment will be outmoded, and Barclay will have to spend\\n$10,000 to replace it. That’s why the government allows his company to deduct\\ndepreciation. The replacement cost of machinery, factories, and so forth is a\\nbusiness expense that someday will have to be paid.\\nThe next stop is Earnings Before Federal & State Taxes. We see here that\\nCompuspeak earned $7,500 in the first year, before Uncle Sam took his cut.\\nMost of the complaining about the IRS is done by individuals who are unhappy\\nabout their income tax rates, but taxes take a sizable bite out of companies as\\nwell. Of its $7,500 in earnings, Compuspeak has to send 40 percent, or $3,000,\\nto the government. That leaves the $4,500 in Net Income that we already saw on\\nthe balance sheet. If the company doesn’t pay a dividend (Compuspeak doesn’t),\\n“net income” is the same as “retained earnings.” In layman’s language, that’s\\n“profit.”\\nCompuspeak is growing very fast, and the numbers are mounting up in all\\ncategories. By the end of year five, the company is selling almost $2 million\\nworth of Interfaces, while spending $1 million on materials and labor and\\n$210,000 on research and development (R&D). The annual R&D budget is now\\nmore than twice what Barclay invested in the company in the first place.\\nCompuspeak is making a profit of $90,000 a year.\\nThe Cash Flow Statement on page 263 helps you follow the trail of the money\\nas it moves from one place to another. The $4,500 Net Income from year one\\nshows up again, in the Sources of Funds section, along with the $10,000 that\\ndisappeared in the Depreciation. Add in the $100,000 that Barclay spent to buy\\nthe original 10,000 shares, plus a $10,000 increase in Accounts Payable, and\\nyou’ve got $124,500 in Total Sources of Funds.\\nUse of Funds gives you more detail on expenditures: the $50,000 Barclay\\nspent on plant and equipment; the $30,000 in inventories; the $19,500 in\\naccounts receivable. When you subtract the cash outflow of $99,500 from the\\ncash inflow of $124,500, you’re left with $25,000. That’s the $25,000 that shows\\nup as Cash on the top line of the Balance Sheet from year one. This sort of\\nsymmetry is beautiful to an accountant.\\nCongratulations! You’ve just graduated from the shortest accounting course\\nin history. Now that you’ve gotten this far, you might as well take a peek at the\\nnumbers in a real annual report. Some of them may actually begin to make\\nsense.\\nBalance Sheet', metadata={'source': 'book1'}), Document(page_content='(STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION)\\nASSETS\\nEnd of End of End of\\nCurrent

It’s about the education of this investor, not any other investor. This\\nstory is not an investment how-to. It’s not a road map. Rather, it’s the story of\\nmy journey and of what I’ve learned along the way. With my own flaws and\\nfoibles and idiosyncratic abilities—and despite my considerable blind spots.\\nOver the years, I’ve stumbled across some profound insights and powerful\\ntools that I’d like to share with you. In most cases, these are not things that are\\nwritten about in textbooks. Because it’s a story about how things happen in the\\nreal world—and because the real world is messy—the topics are broad in scope.\\nThey range from the most insignificant of habits that I’ve developed, like what\\nto read first, to the grandest: whom to choose as heroes and mentors and how\\ntheir wisdom can change your life.\\nThis book traces the arc of a transformation. I started off as a Gordon Gekko\\nwannabe—brash, shortsighted, and entirely out for myself. Then a series of\\ntransformations and self-realizations led me on a path from Benjamin Graham’s\\nThe Intelligent Investor to Ruane Cunniff to Poor Charlie’s Almanack to Robert\\nCialdini, then to meeting Mohnish Pabrai and lunch with Warren Buffett. That\\n$650,100 meal had a life-changing impact on me, as you will see.\\nWithin one year of my meeting with Buffett, I let two-thirds of my staff in\\nNew York go, stashed half of my family’s belongings in storage, and shipped the\\nother half to Zurich, where we went to live. I stopped charging management fees\\nto new investors in my funds. I switched off my Bloomberg monitor. And I\\nrenounced my perilous addiction to checking stock prices on a minute-by-minute\\nbasis.\\nI’m not necessarily advocating that you should also have lunch with Warren', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Buffett—especially now that the price tag has soared, hitting a high of $3.46\\nmillion in 2012! And I’m not claiming to have a special understanding of him\\neither. What I can tell you is that he has had an extraordinary impact on how I\\ninvest and on the way I live my life. My hope is that I can share some of these\\nlessons that I’ve derived from him so that they will benefit you as much as they\\nhave benefited me.\\nIt took me the best part of two decades to get onto a more enlightened path in\\nlife, and I’ve made many missteps and lost much time along the way. Hopefully,\\nthis book will help you to reach your enlightened path faster, and with fewer\\nmissteps. As Buffett once said, “Try to learn from your mistakes—better yet,\\nlearn from the mistakes of others!”\\nI submit to you that if you learn only some of the lessons here, you cannot\\nhelp but become rich—and perhaps wildly rich. Certainly, the wisdom I’ve\\ngleaned—not just from my heroes, but from my own mistakes and successes—\\nhas helped me immeasurably as an investor. As I write this, I’ve had a\\ncumulative return of 463 percent since founding the Aquamarine Fund in 1997,\\nversus 167 percent for the S&P 500 index. In other words, $1 million invested in\\nthe fund would now be worth $5.63 million, versus $2.7 million if it had been\\ninvested in the S&P 500.\\nBut this book is also about the inner game of investing, and by extension, the\\ninner game of life. As I’ve come to discover, investing is about much more than\\nmoney. So as your wealth grows, I hope you will also come to realize that the\\nmoney is largely irrelevant. And what you will want to do with the bulk of your\\nwealth is give it back to society.\\nYou’re not quite sure about that last part? That’s okay. For much of my life, I\\nwasn’t sure about it myself, and a part of me still doubts it. Like you, I’m a work\\nin progress.\\nWe’re told a lot these days about why capitalism has failed us. We’re told that\\ngreedy bankers and irresponsible CEOs need to be reined in with more stringent', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='regulations, and that wealth should be more aggressively redistributed. Perhaps.\\nBut greed can also be a vehicle to something deeper and more soulful. In my\\nexperience, you can start out as a hungry young capitalist, driven almost entirely\\nby greed, and find that it gradually leads you to a more enlightened mind-set. In\\nthat case, greed may be good after all—not if it merely motivates you to acquire\\nmore, but if it drives you toward that inner journey of spiritual growth and\\nenlightenment.\\nI expand on that lesson at the very end. But first, let’s enter the belly of the\\nbeast.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='1\\nFROM THE BELLY OF THE BEAST\\nTO WARREN BUFFETT\\nO that this too too sullied flesh would melt,\\nThaw and resolve itself into a dew!\\n. . .\\nHow weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable,\\nSeem to me all the uses of this world!\\nFie on’t! ah fie! ’tis an unweeded garden,\\nThat grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature\\nPossess it merely.\\n—Hamlet, act 1, scene 2, lines 129–130\\nand 133–137\\nHave you ever felt that way? Utter self-loathing. Unlike Hamlet, at least I wasn’t\\nsuicidal. But I felt almost as wretched. I was disgusted with investment bankers\\nas a breed, and especially the ones I worked with. I felt the same way about my\\ninvestment banking firm. Worst of all, though, I was disgusted with myself.\\nLess than two years earlier, I had felt ready to conquer the world. Back then, I\\nwas a student at Harvard Business School (HBS). For good measure, I also had a\\ndegree from Oxford University, where I’d come top of my class in economics.\\nEverything had seemed possible—until I threw it all away with one recklessly\\nfoolish career move.\\nIn 1993, a few months before I graduated from Harvard, I stumbled upon a job\\nlisting for an assistant to the chairman at D. H. Blair Investment Banking Corp.\\nI’d read a bit about investment banking and fancied myself as one of these\\nbudding Masters of the Universe.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Brimming with youthful confidence, I headed to New York City to meet with\\nD. H. Blair’s chairman, J. Morton Davis. Morty had started out as a poor Jewish\\nkid from Brooklyn. He graduated from Harvard Business School in 1959 and\\nwent on to become the owner and chairman of D. H. Blair, which had been\\nfounded in 1904. People told me that he’d made hundreds of millions for\\nhimself.\\nI met with him in his wood-paneled corner office at 44 Wall Street. The place\\nhadn’t been renovated in years, and it looked like a traditional investment\\nbanking partnership from John Pierpont Morgan’s era. In fact, J. P. Morgan’s\\nheadquarters were almost next door.\\nMorty was a consummate salesman, and he did a brilliant job of beguiling me.\\nHe talked to me about some of the great deals he’d pulled off in hot areas like\\nbiotech, adding, “You’ll be doing deals right away, working directly with me.”\\nHe assured me that there was “no limit” to what I could achieve there with him\\nand later gave me a book by Frank Bettger called How I Raised Myself from\\nFailure to Success in Selling. I liked the fact that Morty was an outsider—\\nunconventional, self-made, and highly successful.\\nShortly afterward, I read a New York Times article that referred to D. H. Blair\\nas an “infamous” brokerage house whose “brokers have been known to refuse to\\nlet customers sell when they request that a stock be liquidated.” The article also\\nmentioned that securities regulators in Delaware had “tried to revoke Blair’s\\nlicense” and that regulators in Hawaii “said Blair was using fraudulent and\\ndeceptive sales practices.” When I went back to ask him about the article, Morty\\ntold me that people envy success and try to take you down. I was gullible enough\\nto believe whatever he told me.\\nSome of my friends from Harvard raised their eyebrows when they heard that\\nI was going to work for D. H. Blair, but I ignored their warnings. I was arrogant\\nand slightly rebellious, and I was determined not to follow the standard route to\\nestablishment firms like Goldman Sachs and J. P. Morgan. I wanted to blaze my', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='own trail and be more entrepreneurial. It felt as if Morty had made me an offer\\nthat I couldn’t refuse, although I should have. So I signed on, thinking that I was\\ngolden, expecting Wall Street to show me the money.\\nHigh on hope, I joined D. H. Blair in September 1993 with the grand title of\\nvice president. I shared a dimly lit, wood-paneled room on the second floor with\\na kind, elderly banker. He hadn’t done a deal in years, but he was part of the\\nscenery, burnishing the investment bank’s sheen of respectability.\\nOnly six months into the job, I was miserable. I had received and continued to\\nreceive a series of hard knocks. For a start, I had thought that I’d be the\\nchairman’s sole assistant and that I’d have the opportunity to observe and learn\\nfrom the master by helping him analyze the multitude of opportunities coming\\nhis way. Instead, it turned out that he had two other assistants.\\nAll three of us had shiny new MBAs: Len had gone to Harvard Business\\nSchool; Drew was from Wharton. This was a dog-eat-dog environment, and the\\nthree of us were not a team. As I soon realized, there was absolutely no need for\\nme on the analysis front. I was learning the hard way about what is normal on\\nWall Street. There are always more people available, and they are abundantly\\ncapable of doing the job that needs to be done. The competition is intense. And\\nthere are dozens of people lined up right behind you, ready to take your place.\\nThe only way I could add any value in this environment, and what the firm\\nreally needed me to do, was to bring in deals. I thought that I was up to the\\nchallenge. After all, it was a big selling point of the job. But the competition was\\nfierce, both inside and outside the firm. And I was new. New to D. H. Blair, new\\nto investment banking and finance, and new to New York.\\nI was determined not to quit, though. That would have been an admission of\\ndefeat. I would have been mortified to let my classmates know that I’d made a\\nmistake. Even worse, I would have been called a quitter, and that reputation\\nmight have followed me. More than anything, what motivated me was how other\\npeople viewed me rather than how I viewed myself. If this had been reversed, I', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='don’t think I would have stuck around that place for a minute; I would have\\nsimply ditched. But I was desperate to look successful.\\nMy singular goal became to get a deal done. That way, I could declare victory\\nand then choose to leave. So I smiled and dialed and pounded the pavement for\\nmany months, following up on every deal lead I possibly could. But I still came\\nup empty-handed. Despite my massive testosterone-fueled determination to\\nsucceed in this, my first job after graduating with an MBA, I was hopelessly\\nflailing.\\nMy problem wasn’t just that the best deals got nabbed by the big names like\\nGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, although that was true. There were plenty\\nof other opportunities around. But successfully bringing those deals into D. H.\\nBlair required me to do things with facts that I had never done.\\nD. H. Blair’s specialty was venture capital and banking. It was one of the\\nthings that had attracted me to the firm: the opportunity to be on the cutting\\nedge, funding start-ups with new technologies that would change the world. Oh,\\nand did I mention that I would also get filthy rich in the process? In addition to\\nmy arrogance and hubris, I also had my fair share of Wall Street greed. I was\\nconvinced that I was on the quick path to Nirvana.\\nThe harsh reality was that companies with technologies or innovations that\\nreally worked and were certain to succeed were extremely rare—even among the\\ncrowd that got its funding from more prominent investment banks like Goldman\\nSachs and Morgan Stanley.\\nInstead, the vast majority fell into the category of “might succeed.” There\\nwere a great many management teams that desperately wanted to pursue their\\ndreams and that were willing to do and say pretty much anything if it meant\\ngetting funding. Before I knew it, I was drowning in a sea of crappy deals,\\nassailed by entrepreneurs who hoped that I would look kindly upon them.\\nThe inexorable logic of expected probability that I had first learned about in\\nhigh school and then studied at Harvard in a course called “Decision Theory”', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='was that if I was going to recommend a deal, it had to have at least a fair chance\\nof making money. Given how many deals failed, and the very small number that\\nmade investors a multiple of their original investment, my rough calculation was\\nthat the probability of success had to be at least 50 percent for the thing to get\\nfunded. But after a while, I came to believe that D. H. Blair’s standards were far\\nlower.\\nOn one memorable occasion I was called into a meeting between the bank and\\nan outfit looking to raise money for a cold fusion venture. Having studied the\\nmaterials and read up a little on the background, I blurted out, “But the science\\njust doesn’t make sense!”\\nImplicitly, what I meant was, “Do you really expect me to keep a straight face\\nand tell our salespeople that this crap is going to fly?”\\nIn another example, our firm IPO’d a company that was going to build a new\\nspace station—in conjunction with the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan—\\nbased on contracts with companies and entities formed by ex-government\\nofficials of this former Soviet republic. The company’s only assets seemed to be\\nsketchy contracts written in a foreign language that were unlikely to be\\nenforceable in a Kazakh court, let alone in New York or London. Like the cold\\nfusion nonsense, the probability that this thing would take flight was pretty low.\\nBut this was the business of D. H. Blair: find some of the more extraordinary\\noutlier opportunities, then hawk them to a naïve and hopeful investing public\\nthat knew no better.\\nTo be fair, even though many of these “opportunities” turned out to be duds\\nand eventually failed, the firm also scored a big hit every now and then. For\\nexample, it had taken public one of the first biotech companies, Enzo Biochem,\\nat a time when it was unthinkable to do an IPO for a company without earnings.\\nAnd from time to time,\\nD. H. Blair even IPO’d businesses that generated real and growing earnings. But\\nin between the good deals, the firm needed fodder to feed the money-making', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='machine.\\nOn the deal side, in addition to cash investment banking fees,\\nD. H. Blair would take a healthy chunk of warrants in the companies that it\\nfinanced. And on the investment side, D. H. Blair was often the only market\\nmaker in the shares that it took public. With bid-ask spreads as high as 20\\npercent, there were fat profits to be made just buying and selling the companies\\nthat went public. Like so many institutions on Wall Street, D. H. Blair had a nice\\nedge on its clients.\\nBut generating trading volume in the stocks and getting a broader group of\\npeople interested in them required a lot of stage management. Dressing up an\\nopportunity with questionable odds of success and turning it into something that\\nthe public was enthusiastic about buying was part of the role of D. H. Blair’s\\nanalysts and investment bankers. To make one of these deals succeed and to\\ngrease the wheels of finance, various people needed to play their part.\\nThe cold fusion and Cosmodrome deals were not going to earn any money\\nsoon, if ever. But they did have sizzle. These companies represented ideas that\\ncould capture the public’s imagination. If an enthusiastic investing public ended\\nup developing a mania for cold fusion or space stations, this could easily propel\\nthe newly IPO’d stock into the stratosphere, to many multiples of its IPO price.\\nFrom an investment banking standpoint, this sort of price action would make the\\ndeal a runaway success—even if the company eventually failed. As the stock\\nrose, the bank would cash in on the warrants and make a profit trading the\\nshares. If the company ultimately went bust, the shares would be broadly held,\\nand it would not be D. H. Blair or its clients that bore the brunt of the loss.\\nTo get these sorts of situations going required aggressive salesmanship of\\nevery kind. So D. H. Blair had a retail brokerage unit filled with hard-charging\\nbrokers who called clients from a boiler room on the 14th floor. They were\\nphysically and legally separated from the investment bankers like me, and they\\nofficially worked for another company. While they were part of D. H. Blair &', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Co., I was employed by D. H. Blair Investment Banking Corp.\\nOur tiny team of bankers constituted the acceptable, respectable face of the\\ncompany, while the brokers were the backroom boys, touting these dubious deals\\nto unsophisticated retail investors. They were chillingly reminiscent of the\\nbrokers in Martin Scorsese’s movie The Wolf of Wall Street, which was\\nexaggerated but not misleading. The 14th floor of D. H. Blair was a swirling sea\\nof testosterone; someone once told me that hookers would sometimes go up\\nthere to reward the most successful salesman of the day.\\nI had no direct dealings with these guys, but they depended on our investment\\nbanking team to come up with deals for them to tout. The bankers could live\\nwith themselves because they were holed up in the handsome, wood-paneled\\ncocoon of the second floor, while the really eye-opening activities went on 12\\nfloors above. Still, the brokers needed us bankers as enablers.\\nIt was only after a year or so at D. H. Blair that it really started to dawn on me\\nthat this was a big part of the role I was expected to play. I was supposed to dress\\nup the least sketchy of these deals in such a way that the downsides were heavily\\nde-emphasized or ignored while the sizzle—the blue-sky upside—was\\nhighlighted.\\nI wasn’t there to act as a careful, well-trained analyst. They had no use for a\\nforensic arbiter who painstakingly researched an idea, examined the opportunity,\\nand pronounced, as accurately and honestly as possible, what this thing really\\nwas. In hindsight, I can see with clarity that the real value to the firm of my\\nOxford degree and my Harvard MBA was to adorn its deals and documents with\\nmy pristine credentials. I thereby provided a kind of Ivy League fig leaf.\\nWhen I look back to our meeting with the cold fusion company, I can see how\\nnaïve I was. In truth, everyone there was expecting me to play my part. The\\nelephant in the room was an unspoken dialogue that went something like this:\\nC : Execs of D. H. Blair, yes, we are\\nOLD FUSION COMPANY MANAGEMENT', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='bullshitting you. This is almost certainly not going to work, but we’ve been\\nworking on it for years and have invested substantial personal funds in it. In\\nany case, nobody can prove 100 percent that it won’t work. Moreover, think\\nof the excitement that this thing will cause among investors and the press. It\\nwould be the only publicly traded nuclear fusion power company in the\\nworld!\\nO D. H. B : Yes, this is extremely unlikely to fly,\\nTHER LAIR INVESTMENT BANKERS\\nbut we need to fill our pipeline of deals so that you, the company\\nmanagement, can get rich on the founder stock and we, the investment bank,\\ncan get rich on fees and from trading the stock. And who knows, it might\\neven succeed, in which case our clients might even make money too.\\nIn the midst of this cynical ritual, I was oblivious enough to mention that the\\nphysics was apparently bogus, remarking, “There are so many people out there\\nwho’ve claimed that they have made cold fusion work, and there’s nothing new\\nhere.” I was so tactless that I actually laughed out loud.\\nOnly in retrospect did I realize that I had instantly become the most hated\\nperson in that room. How could this deal ever fly if nitwits like me couldn’t keep\\ntheir big mouths shut? There was no way I was going to succeed in this\\nenvironment with that kind of reckless honesty.\\nBut I didn’t want to concede defeat. So I doubled down on my efforts, girding\\nmyself for more toil and trouble. I smiled some more and dialed some more. And\\nI pounded many more pavements.\\nEventually, I found a deal with far better chances than most. This time, I could\\nput my hand on my heart and say that, in spite of the risks, it deserved to get\\nfunding. The company was called Telechips, and in 1994 it had a\\ncommunications device that was both a computer and a telephone. The\\nmanagement team was led by C. A. (“Al”) Burns, formerly at Bell Labs, and\\nRandy Pinato, a former salesman for one of the Baby Bells. The idea was solid,', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='although well before its time. This was before the commercialization of the\\nInternet, and cell phones had only recently been introduced.\\nI had also found an experienced investment banker, Howard Phillips, who was\\nwilling to work with me in structuring the deal and raising the funding. Phillips\\nhad a solid background at Oppenheimer and had come to D. H. Blair in\\nsemiretirement. He worked in the office two or three days a week, and he had\\ntaken a mild liking to me.\\nBut having found a solid management team and convinced them that Phillips\\nand I were their path to funding, I discovered a whole new realm of pain and\\nunpleasantness. In spite of my understanding that Phillips and I were equal\\npartners, I soon discovered that our fee split for doing the deal wasn’t going to\\nbe 50–50, after all. He was taking the lion’s share. I felt the hit to my pride more\\nkeenly than the one to my pocketbook. Still, if the deal was going to get done, I\\nhad no choice but to accept this.\\nThe next step was to get the deal approved. I imagined that, given some of the\\ndreck I’d seen in my short time there, this more plausible deal would just sail\\nthrough. Phillips and I went through the investment committee and got a letter of\\nintent stating the valuation and the amount we would raise for Telechips, subject\\nto some cursory due-diligence checks. I was ecstatic.\\nSo were Al and Randy, and we celebrated. They were elated that they could\\nstop exhausting themselves in their pursuit of funding and could focus instead on\\nbuilding their business. Randy told me they had also been working on a highly\\ncredible alternative source of funding, but they were delighted to be working\\nwith me because they liked me.\\nFor my part, I was already pre-spending some of my (smaller) bonus and\\nthinking of how I’d report this news to Class Notes, a Harvard alumni\\nnewsletter. Something along the lines of “Guy Spier does his first deal within 18\\nmonths of leaving HBS.”\\nHoward Phillips, an old hand at this game, had not pre-spent any of his (much', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='larger) portion of our expected bonus bonanza. He must have understood that the\\ncursory due-diligence checks were nothing of the sort. Our chairman, Morty\\nDavis, had assigned this task to one of the other young investment bankers, who\\nthen proceeded to nitpick the deal to death. I couldn’t believe it. He had been\\nperfectly happy to cheerlead many other, much worse deals.\\nEventually, with Telechips management wondering what the holdup was, and\\nwith me at a loss for answers, we were all summoned to another meeting. By\\nnow, the Telechips team was desperate for funding as the company was burning\\nthrough cash. I learned that because of the nitpicks (sorry, I mean serious due\\ndiligence), the deal could still get done, but at a far lower valuation than our\\noriginal term sheet had promised—and with much heftier fees now payable to\\nthe investment bank.\\nI got a call from Randy, telling me how appalled he was by the bank’s\\nbehavior and with me for stringing them along. All I could do was apologize and\\nsay that I honestly hadn’t known that it would turn out this way. I hoped he\\nbelieved me, but I’m still not sure he did. On a personal level, I’d certainly lost\\nhis trust, not to mention his friendship.\\nA day or two later, Telechips accepted the term sheet—as everyone knew they\\nwould. They had been strung along until the investment committee was\\nconfident that the company would have no alternative. I was incensed and\\ndisgusted—not least with myself.\\nLooking back, I now realize that I was potentially teetering on the edge of a\\nmoral cliff. If I had been drawn any further into this firm’s culture, either\\nwillingly or unwillingly, I would have fallen irretrievably off that cliff.\\nIn fact, a few years after I left, D. H. Blair, having run afoul of the regulators,\\nwas reduced to a shadow of its former self. The retail brokerage business, D. H.\\nBlair & Co., closed down entirely in 1998. In 2000, the Wall Street Journal\\nreported that this retail brokerage unit and 15 of its officers and employees had\\nbeen indicted on 173 counts of stock fraud.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Among other things, the retail brokerage firm was charged with manipulating\\nstock prices for its own benefit and engaging in illegal sales tactics. Four\\nexecutives at the retail firm—chairman Kenton Wood, vice chairmen Alan\\nStahler and Kalman Renov, and head trader Vito Capotorto—pleaded guilty to\\nsecurities fraud and collusion to fix stock prices. USA Today reported that D. H.\\nBlair & Co. and its executives paid $21 million “to reimburse defrauded\\ncustomers.”\\nThe investment bank, which was a separate company, emerged unscathed—\\nand no criminal charges were brought against its chairman, Morty Davis. But it\\nmust have been a terrible time for him, not least because Stahler and Renov were\\nhis sons-in-law. In the press, Morty himself took a beating. For example, a 1998\\narticle in Forbes referred to “the controversial figure of penny-stock king, J.\\nMorton Davis,” who “got rich by raising money in the private and public\\nmarkets for companies that tonier firms wouldn’t touch.” When I left Harvard\\nand went to work on deals with him, this wasn’t quite what I had in mind.\\nWhat’s sad is that Morty truly wasn’t a bad person. I remember going for a\\nfamily dinner at his house one Friday evening and being touched by how kindly\\nand warmly he included me. There was much to admire in him, and it’s certainly\\nnot for me to judge anyone.\\nStill, from what I had seen of the culture at D. H. Blair, its problems with\\nregulators were hardly surprising.\\nFor my part, I don’t know for sure how close I was to the edge of that moral\\ncliff. But knowing what I know now, I can tell you that a thousand miles away\\nwould have been too close. In retrospect, I had been dangerously blind about the\\nmotives and ethics of my colleagues. This was powerful proof of just how dumb\\neven smart, well-educated people can be.\\nIt certainly took me far too long to grasp that this business was set up in such a\\nway that, if I wanted to win, I would have to lose whatever was left of my moral\\ncompass. For months, I was focused on the wrong questions, wondering why I', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='was having so much trouble getting deals done and fretting that something must\\nbe wrong with me. I didn’t have the experience or the perspective to understand\\nthat this whole environment was wrong.\\nPart of the problem was that the competition was so fierce. This led to the\\nbelief that, if I wasn’t willing to do something, someone else would quickly step\\nin to do it. This kind of environment is perfectly designed to get people to push\\nthe boundaries in order to succeed. It’s a pattern that’s repeated again and again\\non Wall Street. Through ambition, greed, arrogance, or naïveté, many bright,\\nhard-working people have strayed into gray areas.\\nStill, it’s important to clarify one point. No member of D. H. Blair’s\\nmanagement ever directly asked me to lie or misrepresent anything—even\\nthough I believed that a big aspect of the place was about misrepresenting\\nopportunities to a credulous marketplace.\\nFor example, they would have appreciated my claiming that I had done my\\ndue diligence on cold fusion and that it checked out. Bang! They would have had\\none piece of the ideal scenery they needed in order to close the deal. But they\\nnever said as much in so many words. The rules of the game were implicit.\\nAt D. H. Blair, I observed another pattern that plays itself out countless times\\non Wall Street. Everybody wants to make money. So the senior greedy bankers\\nwho should know better turn a blind eye while the younger greedy, naïve\\nbankers push the boundaries. At Lehman Brothers, they pushed leverage. At\\nCountrywide, they ignored default rates on subprime. At SAC Capital, they\\nturned a blind eye to rampant insider trading.\\nMy experience at D. H. Blair has helped me to see how often this sort of thing\\nrecurs in a wide variety of environments on Wall Street. During the tech bubble\\nof the late 1990s, lousy companies were talked up and sold to an unsuspecting\\npublic. For example, analysts like Henry Blodget at Merrill Lynch were wildly\\nbullish about Internet stocks, dressing up pigs with lipstick. Years later, the same\\nthing happened at credit-rating agencies where analysts issued blindly positive', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='ratings for the CMOs and CDOs that would ultimately lead to the housing crisis.\\nAs for me, my 18 gut-wrenching months at D. H. Blair had destroyed my\\nclean copybook and brought my career to an absolute low. The résumé and\\nreputation I had built for myself at Oxford and Harvard had been reduced to\\ndust. And reputation in business—especially the investing world—is everything.\\nFor years after I left D. H. Blair, I felt so sullied by the experience that it was as\\nif I couldn’t wash the dirt off my hands.\\nEven as I write about this now, my skin crawls. Part of me wonders if it’s a\\nmistake to write about it at all. But I think it’s important to discuss just how easy\\nit is for any of us to get caught up in things that might seem unthinkable—to get\\nsucked into the wrong environment and make moral compromises that can\\ntarnish us terribly. We like to think that we change our environment, but the truth\\nis that it changes us. So we have to be extraordinarily careful to choose the right\\nenvironment—to work with, and even socialize with, the right people. Ideally,\\nwe should stick close to people who are better than us so that we can become\\nmore like them.\\nI hope the decision to work at D. H. Blair will turn out to be the worst mistake\\nof my professional life. But, thankfully, it didn’t break me. In an article entitled\\n“Trauma Reveals the Roots of Resilience,” the psychologist Diana Fosha quotes\\na line from Ernest Hemingway: “The world breaks everyone and afterward some\\nare strong at the broken places.” Why is it that some people are strengthened by\\ntheir traumas and not broken by them?\\nIt’s a great question that can also be asked about business and investing.\\nWarren Buffett made one of his bigger mistakes when, in his thirties, he invested\\nin the loss-making Berkshire Hathaway textile mills. This could have been his\\nundoing, but he later transformed Berkshire Hathaway into the towering\\nmonument of his life. He did so in part by learning to invest in better businesses\\ninstead of betting on the cigar-butt stocks (like Berkshire) that Ben Graham had\\ntaught him to buy. Perhaps D. H. Blair was my own cigar-butt move: a formative', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='experience of toxic shock.\\nIt’s not just a quaint, self-help idea that the people who succeed are those who\\nget up when life knocks them down. An essential component of our education is\\nto learn from our mistakes—and if we don’t make mistakes, sometimes we may\\nnot learn at all. Certainly, the whole D. H. Blair debacle was an essential\\ncomponent of my education as a value investor.\\nOne of the biggest lessons was that I must never do anything again that could\\ntaint my reputation. As Buffett once warned, “It takes 20 years to build a\\nreputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things\\ndifferently.” Another lesson was that I had to do everything I could to change my\\nprofessional and intellectual environment.\\nWhen I discovered the world of Warren Buffett, it was as if I had found a\\nlifeline. The discovery happened one summer day around the time that the\\nTelechips deal came across my desk. By then, I was already deeply disillusioned\\nwith the life I was leading. I found myself no longer eating sandwiches at my\\ndesk on the second floor at D. H. Blair. I’d lost my desire to build this sort of\\ncareer, but I had no idea what to do and was afraid to leave for fear of seeming\\nlike a loser or a quitter.\\nLooking for an escape, I’d sneak out at lunchtime and buy a falafel or a\\nshawarma from a street vendor. Then I’d wander into Zuccotti Park in the\\nshadow of the World Trade Center and play a few games of pick-up chess.\\nOn the way back, I’d often duck into a business bookshop on Broadway just\\noff Wall Street and browse the shelves. The first book I bought there was Frank\\nFabozzi’s Bond Markets, Analysis and Strategies. I was engrossed by his\\ntechnical discussions of asset/liability matching and the measurement of bond\\nduration. For a while, I even imagined myself as a bond trader.\\nOn another visit to this store, I picked up Ben Graham’s seminal book, The\\nIntelligent Investor, featuring a preface by Buffett. I could not put it down.\\nGraham spoke eloquently of owning a stock not as a piece of paper to trade, but', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='as a share in a real business. He also talked of treating “Mr. Market” like a manic\\ndepressive and taking advantage of his shifting moods. As the market veers\\nbetween fear and greed, investors can profit richly by focusing in a clearheaded\\nway on the intrinsic value of a company and exploiting the discrepancy between\\nthe price and the value. Sometimes you know in your bones that something is\\ntrue. To me, this value-investing philosophy made so much sense that it was self-\\nevident.\\nBefore long, I also read Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist, a\\nbrilliant biography by Roger Lowenstein. I was captivated by the details of\\nBuffett’s life. There could not have been a more flagrant contrast between the\\nway he lived and the way I was living. And there could not have been a starker\\ncontrast between my deal-making experiences at D. H. Blair and his own\\nbusiness ethos. Buffett wasn’t working in a snake pit. He wasn’t finding pretexts\\nto sell dubious dreck to hard-working folks on Main Street or hustling for a fatter\\nshare of brokerage fees and then stabbing his peers in the back.\\nI had no clue yet how to implement any of this in my own life. But I felt a\\ndeep and desperate need to get out of where I was and move closer to where he\\nwas. It was as if he were holding out his hand to me so that I could drag myself\\nout of the moral quagmire in which I was sinking. I clung to him for dear life.\\nThis book is about my journey from that dark place toward the Nirvana where\\nI now live.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='2\\nTHE PERILS OF AN ELITE\\nEDUCATION\\nIn order to move forward, I had to fix what was broken. I had to figure out what\\nwas wrong with my wiring so that I could rewire myself. So I began to ask\\nmyself why I’d gone to D. H. Blair in the first place: what possessed a\\npurportedly smart person to do something so spectacularly foolish? After all,\\nthere were many other options open to me. This exploration was the beginning\\nof my inward journey. And one of the things I came to realize was that my ivory\\ntower education had left me dangerously exposed and vulnerable.\\nMy ending up at D. H. Blair was certainly a betrayal of the purposes of my\\neducation at Oxford and Harvard. I’d attended two of the world’s finest\\ninstitutions only to become an inadvertent accomplice in a perversion of the\\nfinance industry.\\nDid my education fail me? Or, even worse, did I fail my education? There’s a\\nlarger question to be asked here, too, since I’m also a microcosm of my peer\\ngroup. Why did so many highly educated people from elite business schools and\\nprivileged backgrounds contribute to and exacerbate the financial crisis of 2008–\\n2009? Did our education fail us? Or did we fail our education? These questions\\nhaven’t been answered adequately by the prestigious universities that groomed\\nall these high-powered creators of economic mayhem.\\nI have to ask these questions even if I’m not qualified to answer them.\\nBecause what was going on in my life was, in many ways, just an extreme\\nreflection of what was going on in the lives of my peers. So many of us went', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='into finance with tremendous confidence in our intelligence and abilities, only to\\ndiscover that the system we became part of was capable of causing more harm\\nthan good.\\nThe unsettling truth is that there are elements of an elite education that are\\npositively a disadvantage. I wasn’t aware of these disadvantages at the time that\\nI finished my formal education or for about a decade afterward. On some level, I\\nhad my eyes closed and was cruising on autopilot for quite a while, wasting what\\nshould have been some of the most productive years of my life. If you had an\\neducational experience that was anything like mine, you—like me—may have to\\nreprogram and rewire yourself in some fundamental ways.\\nThe person who has influenced me most as an investor is Mohnish Pabrai, an\\nIndian immigrant to the United States who has racked up far better returns than I\\nhave. He studied at Clemson University in South Carolina, not at Oxford or\\nHarvard. And when Mohnish and I had our charity lunch with Warren Buffett,\\nyou can be sure that Warren (who had failed to gain admission to Harvard\\nBusiness School) couldn’t have cared less where either of us had studied.\\nDon’t get me wrong. Places like Oxford and Harvard are wonderful, and I\\nappreciate their immense contribution to our civilization. But in lionizing them,\\nwe can fail to discern their drawbacks. So if some of what I say about these\\nuniversities sounds overly harsh, please understand that it’s a harshness born of\\naffection and a desire to build up, rather than tear down.\\nPart of the problem is that a finely trained but rarefied academic mind can be\\ndamaging to your long-term success. You can easily end up with the mental\\nequivalent of a Formula 1 Ferrari, when what you need in the real world is a\\nhardy Jeep that can operate adequately in a variety of environments.\\nTo explain this, let me first give you some background on the particularities of\\nmy own formal education. I came to Oxford from the City of London Freemen’s\\nSchool—an independent high school originally founded for the benefit of\\norphans. Gullible parents imagined that it was a fancy English private school,', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='but it was really a less-exalted crammer. Many of the educational decisions there\\nwere made on the basis of what would get the most students into the best\\nuniversities. Some of the teachers were remarkable. But for the most part, the\\ngoal wasn’t to educate us in a broad sense. Instead, it was merely to analyze\\nwhat it would take for us to perform well in our A-Level and university entrance\\nexams. The system then streamed and drilled us so we could get the highest\\nscores.\\nMy Oxford entrance papers consisted of Math, Physics, and a General Paper.\\nAnd guess what? The system worked: I’d been so well trained that, despite\\ndisastrously misreading the instructions on one exam, I was accepted at\\nBrasenose College, Oxford, to study law.\\nBut now I was alongside students who had been more broadly educated and\\nwho knew stuff that I did not. Although I loved jurisprudence, or legal\\nphilosophy, the curriculum also required me to wade through dozens of British\\ncommon-law cases each week. Now, British common law is a phenomenal\\nsubject. But not for an 18-year-old whose family had immigrated to the United\\nKingdom seven years earlier and who had little social or historical knowledge of\\nthe country. I started to have recurring dreams in which I could press a special\\nbutton that would incinerate every tome of common law on the planet. I believe\\nthat it’s never good to ignore your recurring dreams for long.\\nContrast this experience with that of a friend at Brasenose, Andrew Feldman\\n(now Lord Andrew Feldman, chairman of Britain’s Conservative Party). He’d\\nstudied copious amounts of British and world history and was able to set the law\\nwithin its current and historical social context. For Andrew, the law was a\\nfascinating microcosm of everything he had already studied. For me, it was\\nmorass of intractable case law. I had been prepared to pass exams, but I didn’t\\nhave the benefit of his broader framework. There’s an important lesson here: It’s\\nnot enough to be in a great program at a great school. You need to be in a\\nprogram that matches your particular needs at that stage in your life. Back then,', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='studying law was wrong for me.\\nIt was in this state of dissatisfaction that I noticed Peter Sinclair, a Brasenose\\neconomics professor, every time we passed each other in one of the college\\nquads. He always had such a kind smile for me, as he did for all of the students.\\nAnybody who met him could feel that he was this incredibly benevolent soul.\\nOne day at the end of my second year, I woke up with the realization that there\\nwas absolutely no way I could study law for another day. It felt as if an\\ninexorable force had welled up in me until this wasn’t even a debate.\\nThese moments of clarity are so rare in life, and even the people closest to us\\nmay question whether we should act on such instincts. I believe it’s crucial to\\npay attention to these nonrational convictions that percolate inside us even if we\\ncan’t explain them. My academic training—with its emphasis on hyperrational\\nanalysis—would deny the value of these almost inexplicable instincts and\\nyearnings. But we need to respect these deeper recesses of our minds. This is not\\ndissimilar to the way George Soros learned to tune in to his acute back pain as a\\nsignal that “there was something wrong” in his portfolio. Who is to say where\\nthe mind ends and the body begins?\\nI felt a similar sense of clarity and certainty when I decided to marry my wife,\\nLory. I knew with all my body and soul that we should be together. I had the\\nsame absolute clarity when I discovered value investing: I didn’t think this was\\nthe right path for me; I simply knew it. I’m convinced that Warren Buffett makes\\nhis investment decisions the same way, performing an extraordinarily complex\\nset of analyses almost unconsciously.\\nEvery one of us has a handful of moments like this in the course of a lifetime.\\nBut we need the courage to act on them.\\nIn any case, I walked into Peter Sinclair’s office and asked if I could study\\neconomics as part of the PPE (Politics, Philosophy, and Economics) curriculum.\\nTo this day, I have no idea what possessed him to say yes and help me make the\\nchange. But I feel endless gratitude toward him because that single act may have', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='done more to transform my life than anything else. The minute I became a PPE\\nstudent, I started to feel connected to the world. Instead of reading up on turgid\\ncase law, my workload now felt like an in-depth exploration of what lay behind\\nthe day’s headlines. It was a powerful example of what happens when we heed\\nJoseph Campbell’s injunction to “follow our bliss”: new paths open up, and we\\nfeel a joy at being alive.\\nBut before long, I was floundering again. Even though I enjoyed the subject\\ntremendously, I faced a major disadvantage: two years into my university career,\\nI hadn’t studied politics, philosophy, or economics for a single day, and I had no\\nidea what I was doing. Within months, the academic authorities informed me\\nthat if I didn’t improve my performance, I might be expelled for academic\\nreasons. The chilling Oxford term was to be “sent down.”\\nFeeling hopelessly ignorant, I would stay up for most of the night trying to\\ncobble together a half-decent essay. I knew how far behind the other students I\\nwas. One of them was the future British prime minister, David Cameron, who\\nwas highly intelligent and articulate, and superbly prepared by his years at Eton.\\nWe’d sit together in an economics tutorial with three or four other students, and I\\nfelt intimidated to speak in front of him because he was so much better informed\\nthan I was about British history and politics. Even the professors were impressed\\nwith him, whereas I had little clue about anything.\\nStudents would sometimes banter about Cameron’s erudite performances in\\nhis politics tutorials with Vernon Bogdanor, a renowned constitutional scholar\\nwho is now an advisor to both the queen and the prime minister. Apparently,\\nCameron and Bogdanor would launch into debates over which of the Victorian\\nprime ministers, Disraeli or Gladstone, was a more effective leader. Hearing\\nthese tales, I felt woefully inadequate since I had scant knowledge of British\\nhistory and barely understood the basics of the political system.\\nMy way of competing was to focus ferociously on topics where I could stand\\nout. I fell in love with political philosophy and spent countless hours debating', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='and pontificating about John Rawls’s theory of justice and other esoteric\\nsubjects. Fueled by fear of being sent down and exposed as stupid and\\nundeserving of my place at Oxford, I learned to dazzle intellectually as a way of\\nconcealing my insecurities. I had a burning desire to be accepted and respected\\nwithin this group of exceptionally smart people. This was fun when I was doing\\nwell and winning but not so much fun otherwise.\\nI was driven in large part by what Warren Buffett calls “the outer scorecard”—\\nthat need for public approval and recognition, which can so easily lead us in the\\nwrong direction. This is a dangerous weakness for an investor, since the crowd is\\ngoverned by irrational fear and greed rather than by calm analysis. I would argue\\nthat this kind of privileged academic environment is largely designed to measure\\npeople by an external scorecard: winning other people’s approval was what\\nreally counted.\\nSo during those formative years I was developing a serious flaw that I would\\nlater need to identify and reverse. Value investors have to be able to go their own\\nway. The entire pursuit of value investing requires you to see where the crowd is\\nwrong so that you can profit from their misperceptions. This requires a shift\\ntoward measuring yourself by an “inner scorecard.”\\nTo become a good investor, I would need to come to an acceptance of myself\\nas an outsider. The real goal, perhaps, is not acceptance by others, but\\nacceptance of oneself.\\nOf course, I didn’t realize this back then. So I focused on mastering the rules\\nof that exclusive academic world. I learned to think on my feet and come back\\nwith quick, sharply worded answers that would require my peers and professors\\nto pay attention to me. To some extent, I still operate this way: when I get\\nstressed or feel insecure, I revert to the dazzle-them-intellectually mode that I\\nlearned at Oxford. Only later would I see that this hard-earned skill was only\\nreally useful within the narrow confines of a university and a few other\\nintellectually elitist environments. Someone like Mohnish doesn’t have all of', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='these dazzling skills. But he’s way smarter than I am and educated himself in\\nways that are far more practical and effective in the real world.\\nAnd here’s the rub: what was the point of having studied and appreciated the\\ndeep elegance of Rawls’s theory of justice if I was so obtuse that I couldn’t see\\nthat D. H. Blair was a snake pit? Even once I finally realized that I’d dug myself\\ninto this hole, it took me several unnecessary months before I galvanized myself\\nto climb out. How is it possible that I could be so well educated and yet not have\\nthe common sense or moral courage to get out of D. H. Blair instantly?\\nOur top universities mold all these brilliant minds. But these people—\\nincluding me—still make foolish and often immoral choices. This also goes for\\nmy countless peers who, despite their elite training, failed to walk away from\\nnefarious situations in other investment banks, brokerages, credit-rating\\nagencies, bond insurance companies, and mortgage lenders. For university\\neducators, a little soul-searching would also not be remiss.\\nMy study of economics at Oxford did at least develop my technical skills and\\nmy ability to reason. I eventually learned to analyze and tease out the\\nimplications of various economic policies. Some of this technical knowledge is\\nnot only intellectually elegant, but is also of inestimable practical importance to\\nanyone who wants to understand what policies drive economic success. But\\nthere are also economic theories that, for all of their elegance, turn out not to be\\nuseful at all in the real world. I didn’t have the ability to evaluate them critically,\\nand this academic environment wouldn’t have rewarded such heresy. So I\\nswallowed everything wholesale, without question.\\nThe most important example of this is the efficient-markets hypothesis, which\\nis a powerful and theoretically useful assumption about how the world works.\\nThis hypothesis holds that financial prices reflect all of the information available\\nto participants in the market. That has profound implications for investors. If it\\nwere true, there would be no bargains in the stock market since any price\\nanomalies would be instantly arbitraged away.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='In the real world, this is simply not true. But it took me a decade to realize it.\\nSome aspects of my economics curriculum were so valuable that I somehow\\nassumed that it was all equally valid. Part of the problem was that I had\\nsharpened my ability to appeal to the academicians who graded my papers\\ninstead of training my mind to solve real-world problems. My professors\\nneglected to ask seriously whether the efficient-markets hypothesis reflected\\nreality—so I could safely neglect this question too.\\nI clung to this wrong-headed assumption with such unquestioning certainty\\nthat when I first encountered Warren Buffett at Harvard Business School a few\\nyears later, I had no interest in him at all. After all, if the market were efficient,\\nthe whole endeavor of searching for undervalued stocks would be futile. In my\\npursuit of academic success, I had narrowed my mind to such a degree that I was\\nincapable of perceiving what was in front of me.\\nIn this again, I’m a symptom of a broader problem. The very institutions that\\nwe have established to teach us to think independently often close our minds in\\npotentially damaging ways. Charlie Munger discussed this very problem in a\\nclassic talk he gave at Harvard Law School in 1995 on the “Twenty-Four\\nStandard Causes of Human Misjudgment.” He described how B. F. Skinner\\ninfluenced an entire generation of psychologists to espouse behaviorism in spite\\nof plenty of disconfirming evidence. As the joke goes, “Science advances one\\nfuneral at a time” as eminent but wrong-headed scientists bite the dust.\\nAt Oxford, it didn’t matter that I was misguided in equally fundamental ways.\\nDespite my real-world ignorance, I graduated first in my class in economics. If\\nyou stop and think about it, that should be a cause of some concern. Nonetheless,\\nmy self-confidence—and my arrogance—soared.\\nWith my shiny new credentials, I scored a plum job at a strategy consulting\\nfirm called Braxton Associates. The senior management had all attended\\nHarvard Business School, so I applied a couple of years later and was accepted.\\nAt HBS, the curriculum is devoted exclusively to studying real business case', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='studies. Rather than focus on theories of how the world should work, we focused\\non practical discussions of what had actually happened. This approach to\\neducating leaders is far more robust and practical than the Oxford model as each\\ncase study provides a new set of facts and circumstances to analyze, creating a\\nuseful reservoir of experience. But Harvard also accentuated my hubris. To use\\nan Indian phrase that I love, I was a “topper,” and my glossy academic\\ncredentials reinforced my feeling that the world owed me a living in return for\\nmy general awesomeness.\\nIn my first semester at Harvard, Warren Buffett came to speak at the business\\nschool. In my ignorance and arrogance, I instantly dismissed him as some\\nspeculator who had just gotten lucky. After all, the theoretical models I’d learned\\nat Oxford made it a self-evident truth that searching for undervalued stocks was\\npointless, given that markets were efficient. For me to grasp that he’d made a\\nfortune precisely by exploiting market inefficiencies would have required me to\\nditch all of my painfully acquired academic models. And so I did what many\\npeople do when the facts disagree with their theories: I dismissed the facts and\\nclung to the theory. What I might well have said to him at the time was, “Mr.\\nBuffett, don’t confuse me with the facts, because I already have my firm\\nopinions about efficient markets.”\\nBut if the truth be told, I was only in the lecture room at all because I was\\nchasing after a woman in the second year who’d upset me by going out the\\nprevious night with another classmate. I didn’t even sit down during Buffett’s\\nlecture, and I can’t remember a single word he said.\\nIt’s a tragicomic reminder that my fragile ego mattered far more to me than the\\nopportunity to learn. By contrast, part of what makes Warren himself so\\nsuccessful is that he’s never stopped seeking to improve himself and that he\\ncontinues to be a learning machine. As Munger has said, “Warren is better in his\\n70s and 80s, in many ways, than he was when he was younger. If you keep\\nlearning all the time, you have a wonderful advantage.” Back then, however,', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Buffett was utterly wasted on me.\\nStill, as the saying goes, when the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\\nSure enough, Warren Buffett reappeared in my life four years later when I\\nstumbled upon his introduction to The Intelligent Investor and then read about\\nhim in Lowenstein’s biography.\\nBy then, I was going through hell at D. H. Blair. My arrogance had taken such\\na beating that I was open to Warren’s teachings in a way that I never would have\\nbeen as an MBA student. I had been so humbled and humiliated by my\\nexperience at D. H. Blair that it forced me to reexamine everything I believed.\\nSuch are the sweet uses of adversity.\\nThere is, of course, a certain irony here. Joining D. H. Blair was the worst\\ndecision of my life. But it was also a gift—not only because this humiliation\\nopened my mind but also because my experience there taught me lessons I could\\nnever have learned in the classrooms and quadrangles of the finest universities.\\nIn fact, D. H. Blair may paradoxically have been the perfect place for me to start\\nmy career because it showed me, in a raw and unvarnished form, everything that\\nwas wrong with Wall Street. I saw up close the willingness to distort the truth in\\norder to further one’s own narrow self-interest—the tendency to treat clients as\\nmarks to be exploited, not served.\\nAt their worst, elite investment banks like Goldman Sachs and\\nJ. P. Morgan are not all that different. But the shafting of clients happens with a\\nmuch greater veneer of respectability.\\nWhen I began to understand the principles that Warren Buffett embodied, I\\nrealized that there was another way to succeed. This discovery changed my life.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='3\\nTHE FIRE WALK\\nMy First Steps as a Value Investor\\nAfter leaving D. H. Blair, I had the hardest time finding another job. There was\\nthis stain—a damned spot on my hitherto pristine résumé that I couldn’t wash\\nout. I had mistakenly given D. H. Blair the benefit of the doubt, but prospective\\nemployers were, understandably, not willing to give me that same benefit.\\nMy résumé was strong enough that I could land interviews with companies\\nlike Goldman Sachs, Sanford Bernstein, and Credit Suisse First Boston. But I\\nwas damaged goods, and none of them would hire me. Wall Street insiders who\\nunderstood D. H. Blair’s reputation looked at me like this: either I’d been too\\nstupid to figure out what was going on, or I was a dangerous fellow who was\\nwilling to push the boundaries of what was prudent. Either way, they wouldn’t\\ntouch me.\\nI felt a growing sense of despondency as the rejections piled up. In the deepest\\nemotional recesses of my brain, words like “rejection” and “can’t find a job”\\nwere closely connected to words like “failure” and “leprosy.” I really did start to\\nfeel like a leper. Then there was my inner critic. The voice inside my head that\\nsaid, “What’s the point in doing this? It’s not going to get you anywhere.” Or the\\nmore toxic version of this negative self-talk: “There you go again, you moron,\\nyou’re always failing. You’ll never have a successful career in finance.”\\nBut before long, I would find a way to get unstuck and begin rewiring myself.\\nThe details of how this happened are specific to me, but the process relates to\\nanybody who has been stuck and needs desperately to find a way forward. In a', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='sense, what I really needed to do was reeducate myself. Or, for that matter, un-\\neducate myself.\\nThis process began in the most unexpected way, with my discovery of the self-\\nhelp guru Tony Robbins. His name had come up in a conversation with a very\\nsmart Swiss couple who had PhDs from Stanford. I prided myself on being a\\nserious thinker with a powerful grasp of economics and finance. My intellectual\\nsnobbery made it easy to dismiss someone like Robbins. With all my education,\\nhow could I possibly learn anything valuable from this crass American?\\nI don’t think I would have been willing to find out more about Robbins if\\nthese friends had not been Europeans with stellar academic pedigrees. I hate to\\nadmit this because it exposes the shallow intellectual values that I had at the\\ntime. For me, the beginning of wisdom was to drop these narrow prejudices so\\nthat I could begin to learn from everyone.\\nI had been planning to spend the weekend hanging out and relaxing in San\\nFrancisco. But one of my Swiss friends, Diana Wais, told me that Robbins was\\ndoing a seminar there and that it would change my life. The title of the event was\\n“Unleash the Power Within.” I was full of misplaced skepticism, but I was able\\nto get out of my own way sufficiently that I showed up.\\nIn retrospect, I’ve come to see that this is a smart strategy for life: whenever I\\nhave the choice of doing something with an uncertain but potentially high\\nupside, I try to do it. The payoffs may be infrequent, but sometimes they’re\\nhuge. And the more often I pick up these lottery tickets, the more likely I am to\\nhit the jackpot. This is an application of a powerful philosophy that Mohnish\\ndescribes in his book The Dhandho Investor: The Low-Risk Value Method to\\nHigh Returns. As he puts it, “Heads, I win. Tails, I don’t lose much.”\\nLooking around the convention center on the outskirts of San Francisco, I\\nwondered what the hell I was doing there. This looked like some kind of cult,\\nwith about two thousand people in the audience. What sort of self-promoting\\nquack was this guy Robbins—and what sort of motley loser crowd had he', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='gathered around him?\\nRobbins himself struck me as a rugged, quintessential Californian. He was\\nalmost seven feet tall and his energetic delivery was infectious. Many people in\\nthe audience were jumping up and down, yelling out things like: “Yes! Yes! Yes!\\nI am a force for good!” And: “Step up! Step up! Step up!”\\nThis set off alarm bells in my head. Was Robbins just some poor player,\\nstrutting and fretting his hour upon the stage? Was he just an idiot telling his\\nstory, full of sound and fury, but signifying nothing? I stood at the back, barely\\nparticipating. But over several hours, in spite of myself, I found that I was\\nopening up to the possibility that he had something to teach me.\\nRobbins won me over in part by being transparent about his motives. At one\\npoint, he told us, “Look, I’m an American just like you. My motivation is to be\\nhappy and successful and to live the best life I can. And like most of you, I also\\nwant to make money and be rich. Richer than I am today. A big part of how I do\\nthat is by running seminars like this. But as much as I want to get richer, even\\nmore than that, I like helping people. And I know that I can teach you things that\\nwill help you, and that are worth much more than the entry fee.”\\nIt was a great example of the power of authenticity—of speaking honestly and\\nfrom the heart. His candid admission of his own self-interest convinced me to\\ngive him the benefit of the doubt. So I stayed.\\nIn some ways, my original misgivings were right. Robbins seminars are a\\nform of brainwashing. Shouting things out often enough really does pound it in,\\nand any idea can be implanted by repeating it over and over. There’s a danger to\\nthis—one that can be exploited by religious fundamentalists and political\\nextremists. But in this case, it was brainwashing for the good, designed to help\\nus live a better, more successful life. I’m all for that sort of brainwashing.\\nOur consciousness changes our reality, and I began to see that the positive\\nstatements Robbins got us to repeat were a powerful tool in reconfiguring my\\nconsciousness. Since then, I’ve often found that we have to imagine our future', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='before it happens.\\nThe power of human consciousness was illustrated in an unforgettable way\\nthat first night of the seminar. Robbins had whipped us into a mood of intense\\njoy combined with extreme determination. In this altered state we stepped onto a\\nlawn outside the convention center, removed our shoes and socks, and literally\\nwalked on red-hot embers. I don’t know what the rational or scientific\\nexplanation is for why our feet didn’t burn. But for many of us, this was a\\ntransformative experience. I could see the difference in people’s eyes afterwards,\\nas if a new fire and passion had been ignited in them—and in me.\\nHokey as it might seem, this 20-foot fire walk created a metaphor for how I\\ncould break through my limitations and build a better reality. It was an\\nexperiential lesson that allowed me to understand how, as Robbins puts it, “Life\\ncan change in a heartbeat.” A goal that seems impossible in one instant can\\nbecome entirely possible in the next if only you are willing to devote every\\nounce of your mind, body, and soul to reach it.\\nMy empirically minded Oxford professors—who had done so much to train\\nme in the ways of logical thought—would have been amused and bemused at the\\nimpact on me of this motivational speaker. But his message was exactly what I\\nneeded to hear at a time when my formal education had led me to a professional\\ndead end.\\nFor example, Robbins hammered into my head the idea that, if you want to get\\nsomewhere, anywhere, and you’re stuck, “Just Do It! Just make a move. Any\\nmove!” This might be obvious to many. Hell, it was obvious to me. But my bias\\ntoward analysis-paralysis meant that it was easier for me to pontificate in a\\nlibrary than to act. Robbins convinced me that I had to break the patterns of\\nnegative thought, push through my fears, and get moving.\\nAs Theodore Roosevelt told an audience in Paris in 1910, “It is not the critic\\nwho counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where\\nthe doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood.”\\nHaving opened up to Robbins, I started voraciously reading books by other\\nself-help gurus. Before attending his seminar, I would have rolled my eyes at a\\nbook entitled How to Win Friends and Influence People. But Warren Buffett\\nhimself credits the author, Dale Carnegie, with having helped him enormously.\\nIn fact, Buffett has said that the only diploma he keeps in his office is a\\ncertificate confirming that he had “successfully completed the Dale Carnegie\\nCourse in Effective Speaking, Leadership Training, and the Art of Winning\\nFriends and Influencing People.” I would have been equally dismissive of Think\\nand Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, even though it had won over Prem Watsa, the\\nhighly successful chairman and CEO of Fairfax Financial Holdings, who is\\nfrequently described as “the Canadian Warren Buffett.”\\nFor a while, these books became my life instruction manuals. I wasn’t reading\\nthem to sound intelligent at dinner parties; I was mining them for useful ideas to\\nimplement in my life. They provided me with critical first steps in my education\\nas a value investor and businessman, exposing me to a more practical way of\\nthinking about human nature and how the world really works.\\nFor example, Carnegie explains that the best way of convincing someone of\\nsomething is to appeal to their self-interest. Likewise, he talks about the power\\nof using people’s names when you address them, and the importance of showing\\ngenuine interest in the person. These simple insights helped me to shift the way I\\ninteracted with people. Previously, I would have focused on deploying my\\nintellect to show them how smart I was or to appeal to the rational mind. I was\\ntoo clever by half.\\nI started using the lessons of the self-help genre in a conscious way, seeking to\\nbrainwash myself into new habits of success. I even changed the way I talked to\\nmyself and others. Instead of saying, “I feel sick,” I’d say, “I’m looking forward\\nto feeling better.” Trite as it may sound, having a positive attitude is crucial\\nbecause our minds have a way of moving toward what we focus on. Schools and', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='universities are so dedicated to developing the intellect that we can easily end up\\nignoring these simple strategies that make for a happier and more productive\\nlife.\\nAt around the same time that I was learning these ideas, I was also taking\\npractical steps to get out of my rut. I joined the New York Society of Securities\\nAnalysts and started attending their lunchtime sessions in the World Trade\\nCenter. I’d rush across Zuccotti Park to get there, no longer having the time to\\ndawdle with the chess players.\\nI also bought some software from the American Association of Individual\\nInvestors to screen for Ben Graham–style “net-net” stocks. I put together mock\\nportfolios in Excel spreadsheets and updated the prices by hand each week. I felt\\na rush of excitement as I saw that many of the portfolios I had assembled did\\nmuch better than the market as a whole.\\nI also invested in a subscription to Value Line and pored over the new issues.\\nIt was in these pages that I noticed a company called the Burlington Coat\\nFactory, which seemed cheap and had a long-term financial record that\\nimpressed me. It was the first stock I ever bought. I was captivated by Graham’s\\ninsight that a stock isn’t just a scrap of paper to trade but a part ownership in a\\nbusiness. So I visited the company’s stores in New York and Omaha with relish\\nand excitement, feeling like a true capitalist whose money was at work in a real\\nbusiness. I knew almost nothing at the time, but I held on to the stock for a\\ncouple of years and made a small profit.\\nMeanwhile, I started to see that there was a small ecosystem of value investors\\nout there who operated with the same sort of intellectual and moral integrity that\\ncharacterized Buffett. They were the antithesis of some of the people I’d\\nencountered at D. H. Blair: they eschewed hype, focusing instead on serving the\\nlong-term interests of their shareholders. I felt a burning desire to be a part of\\ntheir world. One company in particular stood out in my mind as a bastion of this\\ntype of investing: Tweedy, Browne, which had been founded in 1920.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='I dreamed of getting a job at a place like this. So I bought some shares in two\\nof the company’s mutual funds, then asked if I could come by to see the firm’s\\noffices in Manhattan. I had hoped they would hire me, but they weren’t looking\\nfor an analyst—at least not one like me. Still, I felt the thrill of walking on this\\nhallowed ground. I knew that Buffett’s old friend Walter Schloss had worked out\\nof an office here for decades and had racked up extraordinary returns.\\nOnce again, I felt the sting of rejection. But they were kind enough to give me\\na copy of Buffett’s classic essay “The Superinvestors of Graham-and-\\nDoddsville.” I brought it home and discovered in it the spectacular investment\\nrecord of another leading value firm, Ruane Cunniff, which manages the Sequoia\\nFund. This was one of only two companies that Warren recommended to his\\nclients after he closed his investment business in 1969 and returned his\\nshareholders’ money. Since its inception in 1970, the Sequoia Fund has risen by\\n38,819 percent versus 8,916 percent for the S&P 500 index.\\nHoping to find a job there, I wrote a letter to Ruane Cunniff and was invited to\\ntheir offices by Carley Cunniff, a director who was also the daughter of one of\\nthe company’s partners. I was in awe of her. She had grown up in a world where\\nGraham, Buffett, and intelligent investing would have been regular topics of\\nconversation over the family dinner table, and she had become an exceptional\\nanalyst.\\nCarley, who passed away in 2005, was generous and gracious. Even though\\nthere was clearly no opening for me to work there and nothing I could do to help\\nher, she took me around and introduced me to her colleagues. In doing so, she\\nshowed genuine care for me, and I was really touched. She also taught me a\\nvaluable life lesson: it’s so important to show kindness and be helpful to people\\nearly in their careers, even when they have done nothing to deserve it. She saw\\nanother human soul, gave me the benefit of the doubt, and did what she could to\\nhelp a fellow value investor.\\nOne way to stay in this orbit was to buy shares in the Sequoia Fund. That', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='would enable me to attend its annual meetings each spring at the New York\\nAthletic Club. But the fund had been closed to new investors for many years. So\\nI found someone on eBay who was willing to sell me a single share for $500\\neven though the net asset value was only $128. I then added to my position. I\\nexpect to keep these shares for the rest of my life.\\nFor me, the goal isn’t to make money, though I’m guessing Sequoia will\\ncontinue to outperform. It’s really a question of choosing to have certain people\\nin your life (however tangentially) who embody the values you admire. As we\\nwill discuss in detail later, creating the right environment or network helps to tilt\\nthe playing field subtly in the right direction so that you become far more likely\\nto succeed. Advantages are often created imperceptible step by imperceptible\\nstep, so it makes a difference to enter the universe of a firm like Ruane Cunniff.\\nMany of the Sequoia attendees were also Berkshire Hathaway shareholders,\\nand sometimes even the Berkshire managers attended. As a result, I met Lou\\nSimpson, whom Buffett had handpicked to invest GEICO’s money in stocks and\\nwhom he once described as “the best I know.”\\nAnother cornerstone of my reeducation involved studying Buffett’s investment\\nstrategy with even greater intensity. There’s no better way to do this than to read\\nBerkshire Hathaway’s annual reports. In those pre-Internet days, that meant\\ncalling up the company and giving them my address over the phone. A few days\\nlater, my first copy of a Berkshire report, addressed by hand, arrived. It was a\\nrevelation.\\nAt D. H. Blair, I’d reviewed so many business plans with hockey-stick charts\\nand predictions that only went up. Berkshire’s report came with a plain cover,\\nand its highlight was a candid, non-promotional, easily understandable letter by\\nBuffett. The report also featured a table showing the annual increases in the\\ncompany’s book value. It was pure information, not an attempt to lie with\\nstatistics or to sugarcoat the truth with pretty pictures printed on glossy paper.\\nI’d never seen a report like this. It was designed to attract shareholders who', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='were genuinely reading it for the right reasons. I’d assumed that the business\\nworld was all about shouting louder than the next guy so you could get attention.\\nBut Buffett was reaching out to people who weren’t impressed by noise.\\nAs I read and reread a compilation of Berkshire’s old annual reports, I began\\nincreasingly to think as Warren Buffett would. I know this sounds odd, but I felt\\nthat he was smiling on me whenever I behaved in a way that he might have\\nbehaved; and I felt as if he had turned away from me whenever I strayed from\\nthat path. This wasn’t a matter of idol worship. It was about choosing a teacher\\nwho had already discovered the truths that I still needed to learn.\\nThere is a wisdom here that goes far beyond the narrow world of investing.\\nWhat I’m about to tell you may be the single most important secret I’ve\\ndiscovered in all my decades of studying and stumbling. If you truly apply this\\nlesson, I’m certain that you will have a much better life, even if you ignore\\neverything else I write.\\nWhat I stumbled upon was this. Desperate to figure out how to lead a life that\\nwas more like his, I began constantly to ask myself one simple question: “What\\nwould Warren Buffett do if he were in my shoes?”\\nI didn’t ask this question idly while sitting in a coffee shop sipping a\\ncappuccino. No. I sat down at my desk and actively imagined that I was Buffett.\\nI imagined what the first thing would be that he would do if he were in my\\nshoes, sitting at my desk.\\nRobbins describes this process as “modeling” our heroes. The key is to be as\\nprecise as possible, picturing them in as much detail as we can. A related\\ntechnique that he teaches is called “matching and mirroring,” which might\\ninvolve changing the way you move or even breathe to match the other person’s\\nmovement or breathing. In my experience, you start to feel what they feel and\\nyou even start to think like them.\\nThis might sound peculiar, but the ability to mimic is one of the most powerful\\nways in which humans advance. Just think about how children learn from their', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='parents. Given that this is a natural human instinct, it’s important to be careful\\nabout whom we choose to model. The truth is, they don’t even need to be alive.\\nAs Charlie Munger has explained, it also works “if you go through life making\\nfriends with the eminent dead who had the right ideas.”\\nLuckily for me, this isn’t a scientific book, so I don’t have to prove or explain\\nany underlying science (if there is any). But I can tell you authoritatively that, on\\na subjective level, this has worked for me. The minute I started mirroring\\nBuffett, my life changed. It was as if I had tuned in to a different frequency. My\\nbehavior shifted, and I was no longer stuck.\\nSo how can you apply these insights? We all know that mentoring is a big\\ndeal. Students and young professionals are often told to seek out mentors, just as\\nthose of us who are further along are supposed to find people to mentor. That’s\\nall well and good if your heroes are accessible. Mine wasn’t. Buffett wasn’t\\nsitting in his office in Omaha waiting for a call from this tainted graduate of D.\\nH. Blair. Thankfully, this didn’t matter. I could get many—if not all—of the\\nbenefits of having him as a mentor by studying him relentlessly, and then\\nimagining what he would have done in my shoes.\\nImagining that I was Buffett, I also began to study the companies in his\\nportfolio, wanting to see them through his eyes and to understand why he owned\\nthem. So I ordered up the annual reports for his major holdings, including Coca-\\nCola, Capital Cities/ABC, American Express, and Gillette. This again gave me\\nthat uncanny feeling that Warren—and perhaps God Himself—was smiling at\\nme.\\nThen the annual reports started to arrive. I vividly remember reading the report\\nfor Capital Cities/ABC. Until then, I had never looked closely at the accounts of\\nsuch a successful media company. When I saw the cash-flow statement, I found\\nit hard to believe my eyes. The company was swimming in cash, and the income\\nstatement didn’t come close to conveying the might of this cash-generating\\nmachine. Most of the companies I’d analyzed as an investment banker were', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='either hemorrhaging cash or grossly overstating their cash-generating ability. It\\nfelt as if I were embarking on a second MBA.\\nI then decided to attend Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting. Through a\\nfriend of a friend who was already a shareholder, I got hold of a ticket and flew\\nout to Omaha, not knowing a soul who would be there.\\nI felt a rush of excitement on seeing Kiewit Plaza, the building where Buffett\\nworks—where the magic happens! I rented a car and drove past his pleasant but\\nnondescript house with that same giddy sense of childlike joy. I also dined at his\\nfavorite restaurant, Gorat’s Steak House, sitting with a group of Berkshire\\nshareholders who were also in Omaha for the first time. In investing terms, I had\\nemerged from the desert, crossed the Red Sea, and found my promised land.\\nThere were two particularly memorable meetings for me in Omaha that year.\\nOne of them was with Rose Blumkin, a Russian Jewish immigrant who had\\nfounded the Nebraska Furniture Mart in 1937, using $500 that she’d borrowed\\nfrom her brother. She transformed it into America’s largest home furnishings\\ncompany, and Berkshire bought a 90 percent stake in 1983 for $55 million,\\nbased on a handshake, without even auditing her books. Buffett later declared,\\n“Put her up against the top graduates of the top business schools or chief\\nexecutives of the Fortune 500 and, assuming an even start with the same\\nresources, she’d run rings around them.”\\nWhen I met Mrs. B, as she was known, she was 101 years old. But she was\\nstill an unstoppable force. She was a tiny lady driving a cart, surrounded by\\nadmiring fans who clearly bored her. When I got the chance, I looked her in the\\neye and asked, impertinently, “So, Warren tells me you sell carpets. Can you\\nmake me a good price?” Her eyes lit up. “Aha,” she replied. “Are you a real\\ncustomer, or do you just vont to make small talk like all zese ozer peeple?”\\nIn that instant, I could see why Warren revered her. She was all business, all\\nthe time, and she was completely transparent. She had briefly tried to retire at\\n95, but had soon gone back to work. Her motto was: “Sell cheap, tell the truth,', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='and don’t cheat nobody.” Just as I wanted Warren Buffett in my life, this is the\\nsort of person he wanted in his life. Over decades, he had created this\\nenvironment. I was just beginning to create mine, and I was learning to discern\\nthe type of people I should have in it.\\nThe other encounter was with the oracle himself, shortly before the annual\\nmeeting began. I was on my way into the toilets and who was coming out but\\nWarren? He smiled at me and said, “I always get a little nervous before these\\nthings.” And then he walked on.\\nWhen I had last seen Buffett in person, back when I was a student at Harvard,\\nI couldn’t be bothered to listen to him at all. Now I was excited to see him\\ncoming out of the men’s room!\\nGiven his success, I had half-expected him to be a distant figure. It hadn’t\\noccurred to me that he’d be so personable and down to earth to a total stranger.\\nEven from this brief encounter, I could see the goodwill he harbored toward his\\nshareholders. Throughout the meeting, I could also see that he had no pretenses,\\nno airs and graces. He is who he is.\\nInspired by Robbins and Buffett, I had a growing sense of opportunity. Instead\\nof feeling that every door was closed, I started to realize that it was possible to\\nmove forward. I was so obsessed with value investing that I hoped somebody\\nwould hire me as a stock analyst. But I still couldn’t get a job.\\nThen, out of nowhere, my father called from his home in London to suggest\\nthat I manage some money for him. It was 1996. At the time, he was probably\\nthe only person who would have trusted me, given my D. H. Blair blemish. Born\\nin Israel to German refugee parents, my father, Simon Spier, had founded a small\\nbut successful company, Aquamarine Chemicals, which trades and distributes\\nproducts to protect crops. He had seen my mounting fascination with investing,\\nand he told me, “Guy, if you don’t break out on your own now, you’d be\\ncompletely nuts.”\\nThat push got me started. He entrusted me with about $1 million. Within a', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='year or so, he invested more, and two of his business associates invested\\nalongside him. As a result, the fund’s initial assets amounted to around $15\\nmillion. I named it the Aquamarine Fund, feeling that I was somehow rejoining\\nthe family business. The fund started trading on September 15, 1997.\\nFor the longest time I wanted to hide or, at least, obfuscate this aspect of my\\njourney. I desperately wanted to prove to the world that my achievements were\\nentirely my own, and it seemed like an unfair advantage to get started with my\\nfather’s help. But I was grateful for this opportunity—and daunted by the\\nresponsibility. In a couple of years, I went from being a Buffett wannabe to\\nmanaging the overwhelming bulk of my father’s life savings, along with assets\\nfrom a small circle of friends and relatives.\\nEven with this backing, my odds of success were small. The vast majority of\\nhedge funds don’t survive beyond 18 months, and it’s tough to make it without\\nenough assets to achieve scale. To cut costs, I ran the fund out of my apartment\\nin New York.\\nIt was a pretty modest beginning. But I felt that I was finally doing what I had\\nbeen born to do. Still, now the real test would begin: would I succeed in turning\\nall this theory into the elusive goal of long-term, market-beating returns?', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='4\\nTHE NEW YORK VORTEX\\nSo I started running money for friends and family. I was 30 years old and\\nrelatively inexperienced. But there were a few things that I got right. In part, this\\ninvolved figuring out what to avoid.\\nWarren Buffett, quoting Henry Ford, often talks about the importance of\\nkeeping all your eggs in one basket, then watching that basket very carefully.\\nOne thing that appalled me and that I’d seen too many times was the Wall Street\\npractice of having many eggs in many baskets. Even the most reputable mutual\\nfund companies have a practice of selling multiple funds. The ones that do well\\nare those that then get the marketing dollars and raise more money from\\ninvestors. The ones that do poorly are either shut down or merged into the better-\\nperforming funds. In the process, the failures are buried as if they’d never\\nexisted while the successes are highlighted.\\nI’d seen a similar thing happen at D. H. Blair. There, the brokers would put\\ndifferent clients into different stocks. The clients whose accounts went down\\nwould be a lost cause, but those whose accounts went up were good for more\\nbusiness. Similarly, the publishers of some investment newsletters have a\\npractice of segmenting their mailing lists and sending different predictions under\\ndifferent titles to different people. They can then make hay with those segments\\nof their overall mailing lists that have done well.\\nThese ruses disgusted me then and they do now. I was determined that I would\\ngo through my entire investing career running only one fund so that I would\\nhave just one track record. Period. If the long-term performance of that fund is', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='lousy, this will be obvious to everyone; there’s no place for me to hide.\\nEqually important, my family’s money would also be in that one fund\\nalongside my investors’ money. Indeed, I’ve invested almost 100 percent of my\\nnet worth in the Aquamarine Fund. As a result, I’m truly eating my own\\ncooking. This alignment of my own interests and my shareholders’ interests is\\ninestimably important. This isn’t a sales pitch. It’s simply a matter of pointing\\nout that this approach is conducive to good investing, not least because it enables\\nme to focus on that one portfolio instead of having scattered interests. In this, I\\nconsciously modeled Buffett, who has focused all of his investing energy on\\nBerkshire Hathaway for decades.\\nBut there were other ways in which I deviated from the hard-won principles\\nthat he had taught me. For example, I should simply have copied the fee\\nstructure of his pre-Berkshire investment partnerships. He charged no annual\\nmanagement fee, but took a quarter of the profits above a 6 percent hurdle. This\\nis an extremely unusual structure, but it’s the best alignment I’ve ever seen\\nbetween an investor and his shareholders. It truly embodies the principle of\\nmaking money with them, not off them. Unless they do well, the fund manager\\nearns nothing.\\nHowever, in starting the Aquamarine Fund, I opted instead for the standard\\nNew York hedge fund fee structure. This meant that I’d receive a 1 percent\\nannual management fee (which would reward me however poorly I performed\\nfor shareholders), plus an incentive fee of 20 percent of the profits.\\nWhy did I do this? In getting the fund going, I was inevitably surrounded by\\nlawyers, brokers, and other advisers who all wanted to tell me how this game\\nworks. To them, the idea that I would adopt Buffett’s unorthodox 1950s fee\\nstructure seemed outlandish. They wanted to protect me, explaining that I\\nneeded that steady income; they couldn’t conceive of someone living off\\nincentive fees that are entirely unpredictable. What they didn’t see was that the\\n1-and-20 fee structure subtly misaligned my interests and my shareholders’', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='interests. I allowed myself to be swayed by them, but I should have been more\\npigheaded in this case.\\nI also wanted to copy Buffett by allowing investors to redeem their money\\nonly once a year. This helps the fund manager to invest for the long term, which\\nbenefits his shareholders. It also helps them psychologically because they think\\nless often about how the fund is doing and whether to sell. After all, inaction and\\npatience are almost always the wisest options for investors in the stock market.\\nFor the same reason, I find it better not to check the performance of my stocks\\nevery day (or, for that matter, every week) since this makes it harder to keep a\\nlong-term focus.\\nIn any case, my advisers thought this redemption policy was absurd. They\\ninsisted that I allow investors to redeem with just 30 days’ notice. The trouble is,\\nthis means that the fund manager is always worrying about when shareholders\\ncan yank out their money. Later, when the market crashed in 2008, this structural\\nflaw would prove to be a major vulnerability.\\nFailing to stand my ground, I capitulated and accepted that these were well-\\nestablished practices in New York hedge fund circles. The whole institutional\\nenvironment made it hard for me to resist. In spite of my good intentions, I fell\\ninto a common trap: it’s always easier to be with the crowd than to go against it.\\nIt gave me false comfort to know that this was the “industry standard” even\\nthough I’d missed the opportunity to create the ideal structure.\\nIt was only later—when I met Mohnish Pabrai, and again when the financial\\ncrisis hit—that I saw how much better it would have been to clone Buffett’s\\npartnership structure as precisely as possible. These misguided compromises\\nweren’t deadly sins. But when I look back on my investing career, it’s painful to\\nsee how quickly I had allowed myself to drift away from the time-tested wisdom\\nI had gained from Omaha.\\nI could have gotten it totally right. A perfect score. I still had a solid passing\\ngrade, but these tiny differences matter in investing—a pursuit where small', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='structural changes can add up to big differences in returns over time. Long-term\\ncompounding is an investor’s best friend, so why get in its way? There’s a huge\\nbenefit to getting these seemingly minor details right from the very start.\\nPart of the problem was that it was so easy to get sucked into the vortex of the\\nNew York financial world, with its skewed values and seductions. I felt that my\\nmind was in Omaha, and I believed that I could use the force of my intellect to\\nrise above my environment. But I was wrong: as I gradually discovered, our\\nenvironment is much stronger than our intellect. Remarkably few investors—\\neither amateur or professional—truly understand this critical point. Great\\ninvestors like Warren Buffett (who left New York and returned to Omaha) and\\nSir John Templeton (who settled in the Bahamas) clearly grasped this idea,\\nwhich took me much longer to learn.\\nAt the time, I thought about moving to Omaha myself, but I had too many\\nconnections in New York that made me want to stay. Still, in those first years\\nafter getting started, I mostly kept aloof from the New York scene and from Wall\\nStreet. I worked in blissful isolation out of my one-bedroom apartment on West\\n66th Street and then in a series of three informal office spaces.\\nOne of these was an apartment on West 58th Street, where Monica Lewinsky\\nwas a neighbor. Another was a two-bedroom apartment on West 55th, where\\nDavid Neeleman, the founder of JetBlue, was my neighbor. I’d read that he, like\\nme, had attention deficit disorder (ADD). Yet he’d still managed to build a\\nsuccessful company. I found this reassuring: having him in the building was a\\nfrequent reminder that I could also overcome my idiosyncratic wiring. As\\ninvestors, we all have shortcomings; as I came to see it, the key is to accept who\\nwe are, understand our differences and limitations, and figure out ways to work\\naround them.\\nIn the meantime, even without a professional-looking office, life was good.\\nThe fund was still tiny, but my investment returns were decent. The performance\\nwas driven by the success of stocks like Duff & Phelps Credit Rating, which rose', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='seven-fold. It illustrated perfectly what I had learned from Buffett: find\\ncompanies that are cheap, that have an expanding “moat” around them, and that\\nare awash in cash.\\nWhile others got caught up in the tech bubble of the late 1990s, I didn’t get\\nlured in at all, partly because I was in the orbit of cool-headed investors like\\nBuffett, Ruane Cunniff, and Tweedy, Browne. Their common sense helped to\\nprotect me from tech fever. This proved once again that environment trumps\\nintellect.\\nAfter five years, my fund had significantly outperformed the market. A slow\\nbut steady trickle of outside investors entrusted their savings to me. Eventually,\\nAquamarine’s assets under management edged over $50 million, and I started to\\nget noticed. I wasn’t interested in Wall Street, but Wall Street was interested in\\nme. And this was, at best, a mixed blessing.\\nI was now on the radar of all sorts of people who wanted a piece of me. Some\\nhoped I would hire them as a lawyer or an analyst. Some wanted to sell me a\\nhigh-priced investment research service. Some wanted to be my broker. Some\\nwanted me to pay them to market the fund in order to attract more assets.\\nThese people hoped that I might be the next Chris Hohn or Bill Ackman, who\\nwere rapidly gaining recognition as two of the brightest investment stars of my\\ngeneration. And these people were betting that there was money to be made if I\\nlived up to their expectations (or wishful thinking). After all, I’d attended\\nHarvard Business School with Chris and Bill, so there was a sense that I might\\nbe cut from the same cloth.\\nI was dangerously flattered. Worse, all this attention had the effect of\\nstimulating some macho desires in me—competitive juices and testosterone that\\nI hadn’t felt in myself since my early days as an investment banker. After all, if\\nall these marketing mavens, ambitious analysts, lawyers, and brokers were\\ncomparing me to Bill and Chris, why shouldn’t I make the same comparison? I\\nstill remember one of them telling me that I should be running $5 billion, not', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='$50 million. At some level, it was as if my very manhood was in question.\\nAt the time, Bill and Chris were going from strength to strength. Based on\\ntheir stellar returns, they were running billions, while I was still a minnow.\\nBefore long, I felt a deep, avaricious need for size and status. The green-eyed\\nmonster had gotten the better of me, and I was consumed with envy.\\nThis is an oversimplification of many crosscurrents, but it captures a key\\ncomponent of my New York vortex. Until that point, I hadn’t ever experienced\\nenvy in such a visceral way, and I didn’t recognize it at the time. But that’s what\\nit was.\\nBuffett and Munger joke that envy is the only one of the seven deadly sins that\\nisn’t any fun. “Envy is crazy,” remarks Munger. “It’s 100 percent destructive. . . .\\nIf you get those things out of your life early, life works a lot better.”\\nIn my view, envy is also an emotion that we deny at our peril. In the financial\\nmarkets, envy is a silent killer: it leads people to behave in ways they wouldn’t if\\nthey were more honest with themselves. For example, investors see their friends\\nmake a killing off tech stocks that are crazily overvalued, and they plunge in\\nright before the bubble bursts. It’s important to be aware of these emotional\\nforces bubbling inside us since they fundamentally skew our judgment, messing\\nwith our ability to make rational decisions. As an ancient rabbinical saying puts\\nit: “Who is strong? He who masters his own passions.”\\nBen Graham wrote brilliantly about the irrationality of Mr. Market. We need to\\nrecognize that this irrationality is also an inextricable part of our all-too-human\\nwiring. A key aspect of my education as a value investor was to learn to detect\\nthese emotional vulnerabilities in myself so I could develop strategies—as we\\nwill see later—that prevent them from subverting me. This process of self-\\ncorrection begins with self-knowledge.\\nThe reason all of this matters is that investing has a way of exposing our\\npsychological fault lines—whether it’s greed, a lust for power and social status,\\nor any other flaw. Envy was one of my biggest weaknesses at the time. I should', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='have been happy with my lot, given that I wasn’t just a member of the “one\\npercent” but the one percent of the one percent. I was in control of my time. I\\ncould live and vacation where and when I wanted. I had people to help me do the\\nthings that I didn’t like to do.\\nBut the problem in a place like New York or London is that there are always\\nso many people who are doing better than you. My office didn’t have gleaming\\nfloor-to-ceiling windows or panoramic views of the Manhattan skyline. I\\ncouldn’t match the elegance of Chris Hohn’s offices in Mayfair, London’s hedge\\nfund epicenter. My beautiful home on one of the Upper West Side’s loveliest\\nstreets lacked Bill Ackman’s leafy views of Central Park.\\nI wanted to win at the hedge fund game. Rightly or wrongly, I was convinced\\nthat I was as smart as my peers, and it ate away at me that I wasn’t at the very\\ntop of the heap. Doing well didn’t feel like enough.\\nI decided to market myself, but I didn’t know how. On those rare occasions\\nwhen I did get an audience with potential investors, I’d get nervous and revert to\\nthe behavior that had worked for me at university, blasting out a torrent of ideas\\nat high speed in the hope that I’d sound impressive. Sometimes I’d find myself\\ntrying to dazzle people with Latin phrases like “ceteris paribus” and “sine qua\\nnon,” hoping they would see the merit of what I was saying if I spoke as if I\\nwere in a tutorial at Oxford.\\nBut the truth is that I shouldn’t have bothered with this mindless pursuit of\\ngrowth, which was primarily motivated by my own ego. The fund was doing\\nwell, and so much of my family’s money was invested in it that I didn’t need to\\nwaste time attracting additional assets from outside investors. My envy led me\\nastray because I wanted people to see that I was managing hundreds of millions,\\neven billions, just like Bill and Chris. That time would have been better spent\\nfocusing on picking the best stocks and allowing my performance to speak for\\nitself.\\nI got sucked into the New York vortex in other equally ridiculous ways. I', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='rented a plush office in Carnegie Hall Tower, and in one fell swoop drove up my\\nannual rental expense from $60,000 to $250,000. I rented a Bloomberg terminal\\n—the informational equivalent of smoking crack cocaine—for about $20,000 a\\nyear. I also hired a chief operating officer, an analyst, and a high-powered\\nlawyer. It turns out that envy and pride are expensive flaws.\\nBut it wasn’t just a matter of winning other people’s approval. It also made me\\nfeel better about myself to have the trappings of success. I needed to know that I\\nwas on top, so I kept chasing after these false idols. My father wisely asked me,\\n“Why are you doing all this? Why are you trying to be a hedge fund megastar?”\\nFortunately, I got plenty of other stuff right. Among other things, I didn’t play\\nroulette with my shareholders’ money, having internalized Buffett’s teaching that\\nthe first rule of investing is “Don’t lose money,” and the second rule is “Don’t\\nforget rule number one.” I was relatively risk-averse in a way that served the\\nfund well, particularly during the tech crash. But I think it’s more helpful to\\nshare my mistakes with you than to dwell excessively on what I got right. As\\nMunger puts it: “I like people admitting they were complete stupid horses’ asses.\\nI know I’ll perform better if I rub my nose in my mistakes. This is a wonderful\\ntrick to learn.”\\nThere are plenty of things I regret about that period in New York. But I made\\none decision that would prove hugely beneficial: I began to surround myself\\nwith a “mastermind” group of investors who would become life-long friends and\\ntrusted sounding boards. It’s difficult, if not impossible, to become successful on\\nyour own. The greatest opera stars have singing teachers; Roger Federer has a\\ncoach; and Buffett meets regularly with like-minded people.\\nOur forum, which we dubbed “the Posse,” met once a week to discuss stocks.\\nIt included investors like David Eigen, Ken Shubin Stein, Stefan Rosen, Glenn\\nTongue, and occasionally Bill Ackman. Through it, I also met Joel Greenblatt\\nand became a member of the Value Investors Club. The Posse met one morning\\na week, and at least one of us had to come prepared with a stock idea, which the', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='rest of us would debate and dissect. This expanded my knowledge beyond\\nanything I could have learned from a textbook or MBA course. We not only\\nlearned more about investing but gained a deeper understanding of each other—\\nabout what made us tick, or not tick.\\nThe Posse’s meetings produced friendships that are a reward in their own\\nright. From a pure investing perspective, these allies have also become a source\\nof competitive strength because we look out for each other. If I call members of\\nthat group and run an idea by them, it’s not just what they say that’s important;\\nmy knowledge of them also allows me to evaluate the information they give me.\\nIt’s critical that we understand one another’s biases and filters.\\nOn one memorable occasion, this group saved me from myself—and\\nreinforced for me the benefit of being open to other perspectives.\\nI had discovered what I thought was a fantastic company. It was called Farmer\\nMac. One way that I look for investments is to study the masters and then\\nexplore whether I should buy the same stock or a better one with similar\\ncharacteristics. Buffett had a huge investment in Freddie Mac and a substantial\\nstake in Fannie Mae. Both companies would subsequently lose their way. But at\\nthe time, Freddie and Fannie were great businesses. Their key asset was the\\nimplied faith, backing, and credit of the US government, which meant they could\\nborrow at virtually risk-free rates. I looked for a firm with a similar advantage\\nand found Farmer Mac—a tiny government-sponsored enterprise in the US farm\\nsector. It struck me as an undiscovered gem of the same ilk.\\nIn 2003, I invited the company’s management to give a presentation to the\\nPosse. Whitney Tilson, who is a well-known hedge fund manager, author, and\\nTV commentator, later shared the idea with Bill Ackman. Bill, who started an\\ninvestment firm called Gotham Partners after graduating from Harvard, is a\\nbrilliant analyst with an extraordinary gift for seeing what other investors miss.\\nA few weeks later, Bill took me aside after a breakfast meeting with the Posse\\nand said. “Guy, there’s something I want to talk to you about.” Knowing his', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='generosity and his relish for acting as a matchmaker with his single friends, I\\nwas convinced that he wanted to set me up on a date. In fact, he wanted to tell\\nme more about Farmer Mac, having heard that I owned the stock. Apparently,\\nBill had stayed up until about 4:00 a.m. researching the company after Whitney\\nmentioned my interest in it. The next morning he phoned Whitney and thanked\\nhim for “the most incredible opportunity I’ve ever seen.” But it turned out that\\nBill wasn’t buying the stock: he was shorting it. In other words, he was\\nconvinced that Farmer Mac was going to implode.\\nAs we walked about 20 blocks to his midtown office, Bill explained what he\\nthought I was missing, and why he’d established a massive short position. He\\nthought the stock was not just going to implode, but fall to zero. He proceeded to\\ntell me why Farmer Mac was nothing like Freddie and Fannie. I felt my stomach\\nturn. Seeing that I didn’t yet fully understand, he invited me up to his office.\\nThere, to my amazement, he showed me a shelf filled with more than a decade’s\\nworth of printed filings for Farmer Mac. These were covered with annotations\\nand sticky notes. He had also printed out the filings for many of the company’s\\nsecuritizations.\\nAt first glance, they seemed just like Freddie and Fannie’s securitizations. But,\\nas Bill explained, they were actually very different. In Freddie and Fannie’s case,\\none securitization typically contained hundreds, if not thousands, of similar\\nsingle-family homes. In Farmer Mac’s case, the securitizations often contained\\nonly a handful of farm loans, each with very different characteristics. Bill’s view\\nwas that this was not an asset that could be securitized and that this was really\\nmore like regular business lending. As he saw it, these packages of loans were\\nfar riskier than they seemed, and the company could easily go bankrupt.\\nAt one point, I said to him, “But this is a government-sponsored enterprise. It’s\\nalmost like an arm of the US government.” Bill replied, “Guy, you have far too\\nmuch trust in the institutions of our country.”\\nAs lunchtime approached, I found myself torn between a desire to stay with', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='him and learn more and a compulsion to rush back to my office to sell the stock.\\nBy now it was absolutely clear to me that I didn’t understand nearly enough\\nabout Farmer Mac to justify owning it. This was an important revelation: so\\noften, we focus our analytical efforts in the wrong direction and miss something\\nvital. So it’s crucial to be open to the possibility that we might be mistaken.\\nDuring our charity lunch, Buffett looked at me in all seriousness and said of his\\ninvestment analysis, “I’m never wrong.” In his case, this might be true, or almost\\ntrue. But as the hedge fund manager Lisa Rapuano once said, “I’m not Warren\\nBuffett and neither are you.”\\nThat day, I sold two-thirds of my holding; the next day, I dumped the rest.\\nLuckily, I was able to sell out at a profit.\\nI subsequently arranged a meeting with Farmer Mac’s CEO and CFO. On a\\nrainy autumn afternoon, I met Bill and Whitney at Penn Station, and we took the\\nAcela train to the company’s headquarters in Washington, DC. The management\\nteam was ready with a standard investor presentation, which emphasized the\\nsuperficial similarities between Farmer Mac, Freddie, and Fannie. After one or\\ntwo slides, Bill put up his hand and said, “Please, we don’t need to go through\\nyour presentation. I just have a few questions.”\\nHe then made the same points he had previously made to me. The\\nmanagement was either unable or unwilling to respond to Bill’s probing\\nquestions, and they were clearly offended. At one point, the CEO said, “This\\nmight not be the company for you.” I was shocked to see that he couldn’t come\\nup with a more compelling response.\\nA week later, I shorted the stock. This was one of only three occasions in my\\nlife when I’ve gone short. Temperamentally, this practice doesn’t suit my nature.\\nBut, to my mind, the management’s reaction confirmed that Bill was right.\\nAfterward, he told me that they had even excluded him from the company’s\\nquarterly conference calls.\\nI started to get carried away with the whole combat sport of shorting a stock. I', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='got on these conference calls myself and asked pointed questions designed to\\nhighlight the company’s weaknesses. I was determined to show other investors\\nthe risks that lurked behind the veneer. I also spoke to the New York Times,\\nexplaining these concerns. These were valid and important points, and investors\\nhad a right to know that the company was riskier than they thought. But there\\nwas a righteous (or self-righteous) indignation in my attitude that didn’t reflect\\nwell on me.\\nIn retrospect, I feel as if I lost my way and acted like a petty tyrant. My goal as\\nan investor is to compound money for my shareholders, not to pick unnecessary\\nfights or conduct myself like an avenging moral crusader. I’m not criticizing\\nother fund managers who want to do this, but it’s not my role in life, and I think\\nit distracted my mind and muddied my hands.\\nNot long afterward, I got my comeuppance. The Wall Street Journal published\\nan article suggesting that various hedge fund managers might be banding\\ntogether to manipulate the price of stocks they were shorting. These included\\nMBIA, Allied Capital, and Farmer Mac. Eliot Spitzer, who was then New York\\nState’s attorney general, launched an investigation, as did the US Securities and\\nExchange Commission. They wanted to know if any of the fund managers\\nmentioned in the article had been involved in spreading misinformation about\\nthese companies.\\nI got roped into the investigation, along with Bill and the renowned hedge\\nfund manager David Einhorn. The investigation went nowhere, but it was a\\nstressful and expensive distraction, since I had to dig up lots of information in\\nresponse to the investigators’ research requests. During the financial crisis, all\\nthree stocks imploded, vindicating Bill’s analysis. Farmer Mac proved to be a\\nhighly profitable short for him and me.\\nStill, I wish I had just sold the stock and walked away, regardless of the profits\\nthat came from betting against it. As I see it, life is too short for this sort of\\nconflict, and these investment gains didn’t justify the headache. Odd as it might', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='sound, I also think we often bring bad things on ourselves when we point the\\nfinger at others or act in a tyrannical way. In my experience, it’s karmically\\nbetter to focus on the positive and act as a force for good instead of getting\\ngratuitously embroiled in acrimonious battles. I wonder if Eliot Spitzer—who\\nwas himself later disgraced—discovered this same truth after years of crusading\\nto take other people down.\\nI yearned to find a path that was simpler and better for my mental health. In\\nNew York, I had drifted off course, allowing myself to get caught up in a series\\nof unnecessary distractions. But I was starting to realize that I didn’t need a\\nfancy office; I didn’t need to attract more assets to my fund as a way of proving\\nto others (and myself) that I was a big shot; and I didn’t need the angst and\\nacrimony that came with shorting stocks.\\nIn other words, I had learned enough by now to sense what didn’t work for me.\\nBut I still needed to find a better way. Little did I know that I was about to meet\\ntwo masters of investing who would help to point me in the right direction.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='5\\nMEETING A MASTER\\nIn my early years as an investor, I wanted to be a superstar and for other people\\nto recognize my brilliance. By nature, I was a lousy salesman, but I came to\\nunderstand that this was something I needed to learn. I started to explore how to\\nmarket and sell myself more effectively. The result was strange and unexpected.\\nWhat I learned about marketing would change me as a human being—so much\\nso that I stopped caring about selling myself at all.\\nI had studied marketing at Harvard. But my true education in this field began\\nwhen I attended the annual meetings of the Sequoia Fund. I became friends there\\nwith a delightful American businessman named John Lichter, who was an\\ninvestor in both Berkshire Hathaway and Sequoia. He gave me a CD of Charlie\\nMunger’s talk at Harvard on the 24 standard causes of human misjudgment.\\nI quickly realized that I’d been handed a mother lode of wisdom that was\\nunavailable anywhere else, and I resolved to listen to this lecture as many times\\nas possible. It soon displaced my Tony Robbins recordings, and there was an 18-\\nmonth period during which this was the only CD in my car’s entertainment\\nsystem. Munger has an astonishing mind. Mohnish Pabrai, who has spent time\\nwith him, later told me that Charlie is the smartest guy he’s ever met—even\\nsmarter than Buffett. What’s more, Munger has an extraordinary grasp of\\ndifferent disciplines, and this speech distilled and integrated his knowledge of\\npsychology, economics, and business in a way that blew my mind.\\nFor example, he spoke about the way that “extra-vivid evidence” distorts our\\nthinking. During a crazy run-up in tech stocks, say, an investor sees that Yahoo!', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='is skyrocketing and hears on CNBC how everybody is getting rich off these hot\\nInternet investments. The investor’s reptilian brain reacts irrationally to this\\nextra-vivid evidence, making it harder to understand that the stock price no\\nlonger reflects the company’s intrinsic value. This primitive wiring—which is\\ndeeply embedded in all of us—was helpful for cavemen faced with a wild beast\\nor a fire, but it’s woefully ill-suited to analyzing the nuances of the stock market.\\nMunger also explained that there’s a “lollapalooza effect” when several forms\\nof misjudgment occur simultaneously. For instance, when an investor sees\\nfriends and relatives making a fortune off Internet stocks, it provides a “social\\nproof” that these investments are a great bet, since 10,000 lemmings surely can’t\\nbe wrong. The investor’s amiable broker then calls to tout these stocks; the fact\\nthat he’s so likeable and that we have a built-in “reciprocation” tendency makes\\nit even harder for the investor to resist his pitch.\\nIt’s difficult for professional investors, not just for amateurs who are new to\\nthe market, to resist this kind of lollapalooza of mind-bending distortions. We\\nlike to think we’re immune, but these forces are so powerful that they constantly\\nsubvert our judgment. And these are just a couple of examples of the kind of\\nmisjudgments that trip us up. In reality, there are many more, often occurring\\nsimultaneously.\\nMunger helped me to understand these tricks that the mind plays on us, and I\\nbegan to see these patterns all around me. Equally important, his speech\\nmentioned Robert Cialdini, a renowned academic who had written a book\\nentitled Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion. Munger said Cialdini’s book\\nhad “filled in a lot of holes” in his own “crude system” of psychology.\\nEach year, on the first weekend in May, I’d make my pilgrimage to Omaha for\\nBerkshire’s annual meeting. I would typically stay at the Omaha Marriott, close\\nto the heart of the action. The night before the meeting, Munger would host a\\nprivate dinner there. I’d hang out in the lobby and watch with fascination as his\\neclectic group of guests passed by—people like Bill Gates, Ajit Jain, and Robert', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Cialdini. This reinforced my sense of Cialdini’s importance, so I read and reread\\nhis books multiple times, consciously pounding in his message over and over.\\nWhat affected me most was an extraordinary story Cialdini told about a\\nChevrolet salesman, Joe Girard, who regularly wrote holiday cards to thousands\\nof his former customers with the words “I like you” printed on each card, along\\nwith his name. This personal expression of goodwill had an unbelievable effect:\\nGirard won a place in the Guinness World Records book by selling 13,001 cars\\nin 15 years. As Cialdini writes, “We’re phenomenal suckers for flattery,” and\\n“we tend to believe praise and those who provide it.”\\nI was fascinated. Was it really that simple? Was it all just a matter of\\nharnessing this “liking” principle? I have a tendency to go to the extreme: if an\\nidea resonates for me, I don’t just flirt with it—I embrace it to the nth degree. So\\nI decided that I would write three letters per working day, or 15 per week. I\\nbegan to thank people for giving a great speech, for sending me their investor\\nletter, for providing a great meal in their restaurant, for inviting me to their\\nconference. I would send people cards to wish them a happy birthday. I’d send\\nthem research reports or books or articles that I thought would interest them. I’d\\nsend them notes saying how much I’d enjoyed meeting them.\\nAt around the same time that I read Cialdini’s books, I also stumbled upon a\\nbook that included many of Ronald Reagan’s letters. He wrote to an amazing\\nrange of people, and he seemed to have a genuine interest in every one of them.\\nHe shared jokes and advice, addressed their concerns, encouraged kids. It\\nseemed to me that this was part of the secret of his success. He wasn’t the most\\ncerebral American president, but he mastered the art of caring for others, and he\\nexpressed his care through letters. If this had worked for the president as well as\\nfor America’s top car salesman, I knew there was something in it for me.\\nAt first, my letter-writing experiment was quite calculated, since I did it with\\nan explicit desire to improve my business. I had a clear expectation of what the\\nresults would be. But it started to feel really good, and I became addicted to the', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='positive emotions that this activity stirred in me. As I looked for more\\nopportunities to thank people, I found that I truly did become more thankful.\\nAnd the more I expressed goodwill, the more I began to feel it. There was\\nsomething magical about this process of getting outside myself and focusing on\\nother people.\\nTony Robbins had taught me that small differences in how we behave can,\\nover time, have a profound impact. And this small action of writing hundreds of\\nletters a year was transformational for me. Initially, it wasn’t easy. I often didn’t\\nknow what to write or to whom. So I’d end up writing to my doorman or the\\nperson who’d served me coffee that morning. At times, I felt foolish. And I\\ndidn’t see an immediate impact. My view now is that it can take as long as five\\nyears to have a significant effect, so most people give up long before they reap\\nthe benefits.\\nIn sending out this cascade of letters, I began to open up to people in a way\\nthat I never had before, and I started to see everyone around me as someone I\\ncould learn from. As I now understand, this habit of writing letters is an\\nincredibly effective way of compounding goodwill and relationships instead of\\nmerely compounding money. Einstein is often said to have called compounding\\nthe eighth wonder of the world. But the narrowly financial application of\\ncompounding may be the least valuable and least interesting aspect of this\\nphenomenon.\\nMy letter-writing crusade had begun as a way of marketing my fund, but it\\nended up giving me a richness of life that I could hardly have imagined. Rather\\nthan becoming a good salesperson, I found myself starting to care about the\\npeople I was writing to and to think about how I could help them. The paradox is\\nthat, as I became more authentic and discarded my agenda, people became more\\ninterested in investing in the fund. This was an unintended consequence of\\nbecoming less selfish and more honest about who I am.\\nA couple of years after I’d launched this writing campaign, I met a Wharton', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='student named Aaron Byrd. He was a lovely guy, and I felt an immediate\\nconnection to him, so I invited him to do an internship with me. Later that\\nsummer, Aaron told me that he was going to Chicago for the annual meeting of\\nan investor named Mohnish Pabrai. I’d never heard of Mohnish, but Aaron said\\nhe had phenomenal investment returns. So I decided to go along.\\nAs I later learned, Mohnish has a colorful background. He’s the grandson of a\\nwell-known itinerant magician and the son of a businessman who had at least as\\nmany failures as successes. Born in 1964, Mohnish grew up in Mumbai, New\\nDelhi, and Dubai and arrived in the United States as a penniless student in the\\n1980s. He went on to build an IT consulting and services business called\\nTransTech, which he financed with $70,000 in credit card debt and about\\n$30,000 from his 401k. TransTech’s revenues grew to $20 million and he\\nultimately sold the company for $6 million.\\nLike me, Mohnish discovered Warren Buffett and value investing through the\\nLowenstein biography and by studying Berkshire’s annual “Letters to\\nShareholders.” He was so captivated that, in 1999, he set up his own investment\\nfirm. The returns of the Pabrai funds have been superb. In September 2013,\\nForbes published an article headlined “How Mohnish Pabrai Crushed the Market\\nby 1100% since 2000.”\\nBack in 2003, when I attended his annual meeting in Chicago, it was already\\nclear that he was something special. He had been compounding capital at more\\nthan 30 percent per year. But I was equally struck by his understated and\\nidiosyncratic way of conducting business. Anyone in the New York investment\\nworld has been to their fair share of “rubber chicken lunches.” These tend to be\\nheld in fancy hotels like The Pierre, and they involve a manager or management\\nteam presenting all of the reasons why you should buy their stock or fund.\\nThe Pabrai meeting was completely different. It wasn’t held in an elegant\\ndowntown hotel but in a Carlucci restaurant with an auditorium, conveniently\\nlocated near Chicago’s O’Hare Airport. Also, it took place over the weekend.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='The guests were dressed casually, and some had even brought family members\\nwith them. This was typical of Mohnish. He didn’t bother to conform to people’s\\nstandard expectations. He wasn’t fearful of being different, but his\\nunconventional decisions made total sense to me.\\nDuring the meeting itself, he went over the fund’s performance, then provided\\na couple of examples of his investment approach: one success and one failure.\\nThe audience, which included about 100 people, wasn’t there to be pitched. They\\nwere there to learn. Mohnish spoke honestly and straightforwardly, unafraid of\\nwhat anyone might think about him.\\nI was particularly struck by his discussion of a successful investment he had\\nmade in Frontline Ltd. I sat there taking notes at a furious rate while he\\nexplained that he had invested at a time when its oil-shipping tankers were\\ntrading for less than their replacement cost. I understood well the concept of\\nbuying assets at less than replacement value, but he gave me a deeper insight\\ninto the mechanism by which the low price itself would be a catalyst to turn the\\nmarket around since the supply of tankers was drying up. In doing this, Mohnish\\nexhibited what Howard Marks would later call “second-level thinking”—a grasp\\nof nuance that is important but rare among investors. Mohnish had a different\\nperspective on the world than others, but his rationale for making this kind of\\ncontrarian investment was utterly persuasive.\\nFor a detached observer, it was an interesting scene. For example, I could see\\nthat two people in the audience were basically there to promote themselves. In\\none case, a fund manager positioned his question as a way to tout his own\\nrecord. An investment banker was also clearly out to promote his own services. I\\ncould sense the unease with which most of the audience responded. A good\\nmeeting is always a team effort. But these two were there to sell, not to learn,\\nand they came across as brash.\\nBy contrast, Mohnish came from a place of personal abundance, which was\\nnot merely a matter of financial wealth: he was comfortable with who he was,', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='and he was happy to share his wisdom. Characteristically, he has since moved\\nfrom a house in a posh California suburb to a more modest home that’s closer to\\nhis office. To me, this is evidence once again that he doesn’t measure himself by\\nwhat Buffett calls an “outer˙ scorecard,” and this is a considerable source of\\nstrength.\\nAfter Mohnish’s annual meeting, I returned home to New York, picked up a\\nfountain pen, and wrote him a short note. Written in my semi-legible scrawl, it\\nsaid something like: “Dear Mr. Pabrai, Thank you so much for having me as a\\nguest at your partnership meeting. I learned a lot about life and investing, and I\\nalso met some great people. Warm regards, Guy Spier.”\\nIt was one simple note out of at least a dozen letters that I sent that week. I had\\nno agenda in writing it and expected nothing in return. I mailed it and then forgot\\nabout it. But Mohnish later told me that I was the only person who wrote to him\\nafter that meeting, and my note clearly stuck in his head. About six months later,\\nhe sent me an email to say that he was going to a meeting in Greenwich,\\nConnecticut. Did I want to meet for dinner? I most certainly did.\\nThat meal with Mohnish altered the trajectory of my life—even more,\\nperhaps, than my subsequent lunch with Warren Buffett. If I hadn’t bothered to\\nthank Mohnish, many great things that have happened since our first dinner\\nmight never have occurred. I didn’t understand this at the time, but I now see\\nthat every letter I wrote was an invitation for serendipity to strike. To many\\npeople, it might seem like a waste of time. But I couldn’t win the lottery without\\na ticket, and these tickets were almost free. In a sense, this is a value investing\\napproach to life: pick up something cheap that may one day prove to be\\nprecious.\\nWe met at the Delamar Greenwich Harbor Hotel. I arrived half an hour early\\nwith a sense of anticipation, flattered that this remarkable investor had reached\\nout to me. At that stage in my life, I still tended to go into meetings with a self-\\ninterested idea of how I wanted it to turn out. But I consciously showed up that', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='evening with no agenda. I resisted the temptation to dominate the conversation\\nwith a slew of my own questions designed to reverse engineer what he had done\\nto generate such high returns. I was just grateful for the opportunity to hang out\\nwith him.\\nPerhaps Mohnish sensed this, and it helped to set the right tone. When you\\nhave an agenda, people smell it, and this tends to put them on the defensive.\\nStrange as this may sound, I feel as if I had some kind of divine inspiration that\\nenabled me to understand that I needed to be myself with him. His own\\nauthenticity made me see the foolishness of being fake or insincere.\\nWhat I saw during that meal was a man completely at ease with himself. The\\nperson on the outside was the same as the person on the inside; he wasn’t\\npretending to be anything to anybody. So often in my life, I wasn’t aligned or at\\npeace with myself. But in Mohnish’s presence, from the very start, I was myself.\\nMisalignment is a dangerous thing, not just in relationships but in business and\\ninvesting. For example, Charlie Munger points out that it’s always easier to be\\ntruthful because you don’t have to remember your lies. This relieves your brain\\nof much unnecessary mental work so that it can focus on something more useful.\\nMohnish talked to me during that meal about a book called Power vs. Force:\\nThe Hidden Determinants of Human Behavior. The author, David Hawkins,\\nexplores the theory that we have a greater capacity to influence others when\\nwe’re an authentic version of ourselves since this truthfulness evokes a deep\\npsychological response in others. Mohnish himself seemed to embody this idea\\nthat real power resides with a person who is honest and in touch with himself.\\nOur discussion planted a seed in me: in the future, I wanted to be truly authentic,\\ncompleting the transformation I had begun when I left D. H. Blair and that whole\\nworld of lies.\\nI quickly realized that Mohnish, like me, had been on a quest for worldly\\nwisdom. But he had arrived at it from a different direction and with a very\\ndifferent mind. From Tony Robbins I had discovered the power of modeling the', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='habits of successful people; Mohnish, who referred to this as “cloning,”\\nsometimes jokes that he’s never had an original idea in his life, but this doesn’t\\nbother him in the least. Indeed, this is often the way progress works: we copy the\\nbest ideas and make them our own.\\nMohnish understood that this applies to businesses too. Companies can profit\\nrichly by studying their competitors, figuring out what they do well, then\\nrecreating it. He used the example of two gas stations on either side of the same\\nroad. One has a smart owner who provides a full serve at a self-serve price,\\ndoing things like cleaning windscreens and checking fluid levels for free. In\\nother words, the owner constantly takes small actions that improve the business,\\ncreating a virtuous cycle. The gas station across the road fails to do these things\\nand languishes. Yet, as Mohnish pointed out, it would be easy for the owner of\\nthe bad gas station to copy everything that his more successful rival is doing.\\nMany of the best ideas are already out there for us to see; we just have to clone\\nthem.\\nThis is what Mohnish and I had also learned to do in our investing careers. We\\nsaw what Buffett had done, and we consciously sought to copy him. But\\nMohnish was a much better cloner than I was, thanks to his relentless attention\\nto detail. For example, he had carefully replicated Buffett’s original investment\\npartnerships, including their fee structure and redemption terms; it took me more\\nthan a decade to understand that I should have done this myself when I opened\\nmy fund.\\nDuring our dinner, I joined Mohnish in pitying the fools who fail to copy the\\ngreat ideas that are already out there. But a few years later, I was humbled to\\nrealize that I resembled the owner of the gas station on the other side of the road\\nwhile Mohnish was the owner of the more successful gas station. As we will\\ndiscuss later, I eventually wised up and learned from him.\\nMy next meeting with Mohnish had an even greater impact on my life. I had\\nno idea whether he’d enjoyed our dinner as much as I had, so I was delighted', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='when he emailed me some months later and asked me to join him for breakfast\\nin New York. He was there to give a presentation at the Value Investing\\nCongress. I wanted to make sure that our meeting was memorable since I\\nintuitively knew that it was important to my life. I picked the restaurant at the\\nMandarin Oriental Hotel, which has stunning views over Central Park and was\\nconvenient for Mohnish’s conference. The day before our breakfast, I even\\nvisited the restaurant to make sure that we’d have a good table and that the bill\\nwould be presented to me, not to my guest.\\nThis might sound over the top. But it’s an illustration of something I had\\nlearned from Mohnish: some businesses succeed because they get one thing\\nright, but most succeed because they get a lot of small things right. This is what\\nmade a company like Wal-Mart so successful. A key aspect of my real-world\\neducation involved learning to take more and more of these intelligent but\\npractical actions on a micro level: writing thank-you notes, picking a great place\\nfor breakfast, listening actively to what people told me, or treating them the way\\nI wished to be treated. Over a lifetime, a myriad of simple actions like these can\\naccumulate to create big reputational and relationship advantages. It’s not about\\nluck. It’s about working harder to get these things right so that it becomes more\\nlikely that something good will happen.\\nThe breakfast was wonderful. At first, I was in awe of Mohnish. After all, my\\ninvestment returns were good and I had a decent intellect, but his returns were\\nspectacular, and his mind is so exceptional that it made me feel pedestrian. We\\nalso have different cognitive styles: I can be scatterbrained, with a mind that\\ndarts all over the place, while he’s totally directed. But we had much in common,\\nincluding a deep-seated sense that we were both outsiders. I came from a family\\nof Jewish refugees from Germany who had achieved success in Israel and\\nEngland; he was an Indian immigrant who had made it big in America. For\\nwhatever reason, I felt increasingly connected to him both emotionally and\\nintellectually, even though I was sure that I had nothing to teach him.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='As we sat by the window at the Mandarin overlooking the park and the\\nManhattan skyline, Mohnish raised an idea that had never occurred to me. He\\nwondered if we should join forces to bid for a charity lunch with Warren Buffett\\nthat is auctioned on eBay each year. At first, I thought it was insane to spend\\nhundreds of thousands of dollars on a single meal, even with an investor who\\nhad already changed my life. I tried to be polite, remarking, “That seems like an\\nawful lot to pay for a lunch. Why would anybody do it?”\\nThis was a conventionally sensible point, but Mohnish patiently walked me\\nthrough his unconventional analysis of why it made all the sense in the world to\\nbid for the lunch. He pointed out that the money would go to a very worthy\\ncharity, the GLIDE Foundation, with the added benefit of lunch with Warren\\nthrown in. As Mohnish understood, so many charitable donations come with\\nnothing more than a meaningless plaque featuring the donor’s name, which is\\ndesigned primarily to burnish their reputation or inflate their ego. In this case,\\nthe donation would bring with it something infinitely more valuable: a meeting\\nwith a towering role model who offers a far more enlightened example of how to\\nbe a capitalist.\\nMohnish also helped me to see that there was no need to seek anything\\ntangible from the lunch. Rather, it was our opportunity to enjoy Buffett’s\\ncompany and thank him for everything he had taught us. By the end of breakfast,\\nI was totally convinced.\\nSo we agreed to team up and bid together for the lunch with Buffett. That first\\nyear, we lost the auction to a higher bidder. But the following year, Mohnish was\\ndetermined to bid again. I was traveling in Europe when he rang me on my\\nmobile phone. “Guy,” he said. “This time we’ve got to win it.”\\nIf we won, the plan was that Mohnish would bring his wife and daughters with\\nhim, while I’d be joined by my wife alone, as our children were too young to\\nattend. Since there would be more Pabrais than Spiers at the lunch, Mohnish\\nkindly proposed to pay for two-thirds of whatever it cost, while I would pay for', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='one-third.\\nEven so, I was worried that the bidding might get out of hand. I was still a\\nyoung money manager running a small fund, and Lory and I were expecting our\\nthird child, so we might need to move to a bigger home in Manhattan. I told\\nMohnish that I was good for $250,000 but said that I didn’t think it was prudent\\nfor me to go beyond that. If the bidding went above $750,000, as he expected, I\\nmight well have to drop out. Mohnish paused for a moment. Then he assured me\\nthat, if this happened, he’d cover the balance himself so that my contribution\\nwould be capped at $250,000. I was flabbergasted by his generosity.\\nWe didn’t even shake hands on this deal, let alone draw up a written\\nagreement. I found this level of trust deeply touching. It reminded me of the way\\nthat Buffett himself had often made financial agreements with barely a written\\ndocument. Nobody in business other than my father had ever treated me this\\nway.\\nIn the end, we won the auction at our second attempt, with a bid of $650,100. I\\nwas so excited—and so anxious for Mohnish not to think that I might let him\\ndown—that I wired my third of the money to the GLIDE Foundation the very\\nnext morning. Only then, once the money had gone through and it was a fait\\naccompli, did I call Mohnish to tell him how ecstatic I was.\\nOur lunch was set for June 25, 2008. This would give me several months to\\nprepare myself—just enough time, I hoped, to make sure that I was worthy of\\nmeeting the grand master himself.

In the\\nlate 1990s, as tech stocks soared, Berkshire Hathaway lagged, and there was\\nplenty of misguided muttering about how he had “lost his touch.” The skeptics\\nwondered why he stuck to his supposedly outmoded style of investing in unsexy\\n—but highly profitable—businesses while the herd made a killing off hot tech\\nstocks that traded at crazy multiples of their revenues.\\nAmid this insanity, Berkshire’s unfashionable stock slumped to what struck\\nme as an irrationally low price. So I loaded up, investing over 20 percent of my\\nfund in the company. Since then, the stock has more than quadrupled while\\nmany of those once-hot tech darlings have gone the way of the dodo. Berkshire\\nhas remained a big investment for me, providing an important anchor for my\\nfund, and it’s still capable of generating high returns for many years to come.\\nIn the meantime, I was constantly striving to model Buffett’s way of thinking\\nand investing. I read about him incessantly, studied the stocks he bought, and did\\nmy best to replicate what made him great. By the time of our charity lunch, I had\\nalso visited Omaha about a dozen times to attend his annual meeting.\\nIn those early years of going to Omaha, I was still stuck in my New York\\nvortex, so I typically hung out at the Omaha Marriott with other high-finance\\ntypes from the Big Apple. This gradually changed. Instead of mingling with the\\nNew York crowd, I began to stay at the DoubleTree Hotel, joining the members\\nof a Buffett fan club called the Yellow BRKers. Their website warns: “The\\nYellow BRKer Gathering is a 100% informal and unofficial gathering of', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Berkshire shareholders. The gathering is not intended as a forum to promote any\\nparticular product [or] service.”\\nThe people in this group weren’t dressed for success, and they didn’t have the\\nslightest interest in doing business at the Berkshire meeting. They were there to\\nlearn, to celebrate friendship, and to drink from the well of wisdom. These were\\nprimarily amateurs who had invested their own money in Berkshire. In many\\ncases, they had owned the stock for decades. They had a different energy from\\nthat of my New York colleagues—professional investors and networkers who\\noften wore a standard uniform of khaki pants and blue blazers.\\nThrough Mohnish, I also met various Indian fans of Warren, some of whom\\nhad traveled thousands of miles to be in Omaha. I liked hanging out with all\\nthese nonprofessionals who weren’t interested in dealmaking or working the\\nroom. They didn’t take themselves too seriously, and we became a raucously\\nfunny gang. For me, the values and ethos of this understated group seemed\\nhealthier and more down-to-earth.\\nInstead of showing up in my jaded and superior Oxford-Harvard-New York\\nmode, I allowed myself to let go and join the fun as just another Buffett fan and\\ndisciple. On the day of the annual meeting itself, I no longer strolled in at the\\n8:00 a.m. start time so that I could avoid the rush. Instead, I began to get up at\\n5:30 a.m. so that I could join the hard-core faithful in a line by the south door of\\nthe convention center.\\nAs a result, I would find myself sitting with Mohnish at the front of the room,\\nenjoying a perfect view of Warren and Charlie. This was a much better place\\nfrom which to learn than the back row, where I had previously been a more\\npassive and even judgmental observer. As I had come to realize, if you’re going\\nto do something, it’s best to commit to it with wholehearted gusto. Other serious\\ninvestors—including Prem Watsa, Li Lu, and Mario Gabelli—had clearly come\\nto the same conclusion because I found them at the front too. Once again, the\\npoint is that these small actions make a major difference at the margin.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Other than my one decidedly brief exchange with Buffett as he left the men’s\\nroom in the Omaha convention center, I had never had any personal interaction\\nwith him at all. For all these years, I’d simply watched him and studied him from\\nafar. But my letter-writing campaign—which had led to my meeting with\\nMohnish and then to our successful bid for the charity lunch—now propelled me\\ninto a whole new realm of possibility. Suddenly, I was about to meet my hero in\\nperson, for lunch!\\nIt seemed unreal. I was only just beginning to align myself with the universe,\\nand I hadn’t even done that much that was right. But when you begin to change\\nyourself internally, the world around you responds. I hope this idea resonates\\nbecause it’s important—more important, perhaps, than the fact that I had lunch\\nwith Warren Buffett. As I hope you can see from my experience, when your\\nconsciousness or mental attitude shifts, remarkable things begin to happen. That\\nshift is the ultimate business tool and life tool.\\nI had already changed a lot in the years since D. H. Blair. But there were\\naspects of my hedge fund’s business model that were still misaligned. As the\\nlunch with Buffett approached, I felt a growing sense of discomfort about this. A\\npart of me feared that he would see me and recoil at the sight of just another\\ngreedy hedgie from New York, reaming investors by charging a 1 percent annual\\nmanagement fee and 20 percent of the profits.\\nMohnish didn’t charge an annual management fee; he got compensated only if\\nhis shareholders did well. As for Warren, his annual salary for running Berkshire\\nwas $100,000—almost comically low given the many billions of dollars in\\nprofits he had made for his fellow shareholders. So I’d be showing up at the\\nlunch with the highest fees and the most self-serving fee structure despite\\nrunning the least amount of money and having the lowest returns of the three of\\nus. It’s painful to write this, but it’s true.\\nI could have tried to exculpate myself by pointing at the many hedge fund\\nmanagers who charge a 2 percent annual management fee. But the fact that their', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='fee structure was even more egregious than mine gave me little comfort. I wasn’t\\nthe worst offender, but I wanted to be on the right side of the line. Buffett wasn’t\\naware that he was having this impact on me, but he set such a great example\\nwith his own fee structure that he made me want to treat my own shareholders\\nmore fairly. This was part of the power of the mere expectation of meeting him.\\nThere’s a joke on Wall Street that a hedge fund is really just a fee structure in\\nsearch of an investor to fleece. I didn’t want to be part of this system, but I had\\nallowed it to happen, buckling far too readily under pressure from advisers who\\nhad told me that this was standard operating procedure. Now, faced with the\\ncontrast between Buffett and me, I felt that it would be unbearable to show up at\\nthe lunch as the only person who charged an annual management fee.\\nSo I instituted a new share class for my fund, mirroring the fee structure of\\nBuffett’s original partnerships. Existing shareholders could stick with the old\\narrangement if they preferred, but they now also had a better long-term option:\\nin the new share class, they would pay no annual management fee, and I wasn’t\\nentitled to receive an incentive fee until after they had received a 6 percent\\nannual return on their investment. Above that hurdle, I’d receive a quarter of the\\nprofits, getting handsomely compensated only if my shareholders did well too. I\\nshould have done this a decade earlier, setting myself on the right path from day\\none.\\nSmart investors innately understand why this new fee structure makes sense.\\nSo this shift would later have the benefit of attracting the right long-term\\npartners for the fund without my trying to sell to people who couldn’t grasp my\\nreal objective.\\nIn my early days as a money manager, slick marketers wanted to help me sell\\nthe fund to more investors so that it would grow bigger and more profitable. This\\nnever really worked, and I was chasing after success in the wrong place. What\\nended up working best was to look inward, changing myself internally and\\nputting my shareholders’ interests before my own. As in so many areas, it took', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='me years to learn what Buffett already knew.\\nBefore our lunch, I also wanted to visit the GLIDE Foundation, the charity he\\nhad chosen to support. I was curious to see why he was donating his time to this\\nparticular organization. As I’ve come to understand, if you encounter someone\\nwho has exceptional qualities, it’s worth investing the time and energy to travel\\nso that you can be in their force field. GLIDE was in Buffett’s force field, and I\\nwanted to know why.\\nSo I flew to San Francisco to find out more about this remarkable charity,\\nwhich has the mission of creating “a radically inclusive, just and loving\\ncommunity.” Among its initiatives, GLIDE runs a church in the impoverished\\nTenderloin district, provides health services, and serves over 800,000 meals a\\nyear to the needy. Warren had been introduced to GLIDE by his late wife, Susan,\\nwho was an extraordinarily generous soul. He began to support the charity by\\nauctioning his annual lunch online, and he continued to do so after Susan passed\\naway in 2004.\\nI was greeted outside GLIDE’s headquarters by its beaming founder, Reverend\\nCecil Williams, a minister and social activist on behalf of the poor and\\nmarginalized. Here was a man who, like Buffett, did his job with every ounce of\\nhis being. Later I had lunch with him in GLIDE’s soup kitchen, seeing for\\nmyself how he bantered with everyone and how they were drawn to him. It\\ndidn’t take long to realize that this is a wonderful organization that extends\\ngenuine warmth and humanity to people who have given up on themselves. As\\nBuffett once put it, GLIDE recognizes that everyone has “a potential, no matter\\nwhat their circumstances. This is a proven process, that a combination of love\\nand time and energy and resources can produce a different human being.”\\nWhat also dawned on me was that Reverend Williams was a quintessential\\nBuffett manager—not that different from the CEOs who run Berkshire’s\\nbusinesses. He was authentic to the core. There was no façade. He gave his own\\nattention and energy to the people he helped. And he obviously relished his', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='work. Later that day, I recorded a video for GLIDE in which I mentioned that\\nBuffett was not just “a very discerning picker of businesses” but had also clearly\\nidentified “a very special charity.”\\nMore important, perhaps, the GLIDE visit showed me how concerned Buffett\\nwas with using his power to do good. His example encouraged me to keep\\nlooking outside myself to see who I could help—and the more I did this, the\\nhappier my life became.\\nAccording to the rules of the auction, Mohnish and I had specifically won a\\n“power lunch” for seven people—plus Warren—at the Smith & Wollensky\\nsteakhouse in Manhattan. Our party would include Mohnish, his wife Harina,\\ntheir two daughters Monsoon and Momachi, along with Lory and me. In other\\nwords, there were only six of us, which meant that there was technically a spare\\nseat. Various acquaintances had approached me to buy that last seat. One\\nLondon-based fund manager offered me $100,000 to join us. A swaggering\\nprivate equity guy suggested that we give the seat to David Cameron and also\\ndisinvite our families.\\nWhen Lory heard about these bids, she selflessly offered to give up her own\\nseat so that we could give it to someone who would value it more highly. But\\nthis wasn’t a business deal, and her seat wasn’t for sale. Still, I felt obliged to\\nmention the $100,000 offer to Mohnish. He was adamant: this was a family\\nevent and a way of thanking Warren. There was no hidden agenda. Auctioning\\noff the seats or allowing nonfamily members to come with us would have\\nquickly destroyed that spirit.\\nAt last, the day of the lunch arrived. It was a beautifully sunny morning in late\\nJune. Lory and I rode in a cab from our apartment to the restaurant, which is on\\n49th Street and Third Avenue. We arrived an hour early as I wanted to savor the\\nmoment and didn’t want to be late for such an important occasion. Television\\ncameras from CNBC and elsewhere were already stationed outside the\\nrestaurant. With Warren’s permission, we had also hired our wedding', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='photographer to memorialize the event.\\nI was so nervous that I was run down and had a cold. I knew that Buffett was a\\npenetrating judge of character, and I was afraid of being exposed. What if he saw\\nthrough me and detected any lingering remnants of the Gordon Gekko side of\\nmy nature? But I was also enormously excited. From my meals with Mohnish,\\nI’d seen what a huge impact it can have simply to hang out with a person you\\nrevere. So I was thrilled at the prospect of seeing Warren up close, of observing\\nwhat made him tick. This would be the ultimate capitalist master class.\\nAt around 12:30 p.m., the seven of us sat down for lunch in a cozy, wood-\\npaneled alcove near the kitchen. It was only semiprivate, and there was a buzz\\namong the other diners when they peered into the alcove and saw that Warren\\nBuffett was there. He wore a business suit, a white shirt, and a bright yellow tie\\nwith a black pattern. Mohnish’s daughters sat on either side of him. I sat two\\nseats to his right, between Momachi and Lory. Mohnish and Harina sat to\\nBuffett’s left.\\nIt was lovely to have our wives and Mohnish’s kids there since this made it a\\nlighthearted and joyful family affair instead of a more formal business meeting.\\nWarren, who had brought gifts for the two girls, beamed with pleasure and\\ngoodwill—more like an amiable grandfather than one of the world’s richest men\\nand the greatest investor of all time.\\nAs I’d seen at Berkshire’s annual meetings, he had no pretenses or stuffiness\\nabout him. Warm and friendly, he insisted on our calling him Warren and went\\nout of his way to put us all at our ease. He asked the girls how old they were, and\\nthen replied: “You’re 12, you’re 11, and I’m 77.” Then, when the menus arrived,\\nhe joked with the kids that he doesn’t eat anything he wouldn’t touch when he\\nwas less than five years old. Sure enough, he ordered a medium-rare steak, hash\\nbrowns, and a Cherry Coke—an appropriate choice, given that Berkshire is the\\nbiggest shareholder in Coca-Cola. Not wanting to dwell on the menu, I followed\\nhis lead, ordering a steak, hash browns, and a Diet Coke.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Before the lunch, Buffett had obviously gone to the trouble of reading up on\\nus. He asked Lory about Salisbury, North Carolina, where she was born,\\nmentioning that he’d spent time there with a friend from his student days at\\nColumbia University. He also made a point of saying how impressed he’d been\\nby a remarkable annual report for Mohnish’s charitable foundation, Dakshana,\\nwhich educates children in India. He floored Mohnish by saying that he’d sent\\nthe report to Charlie Munger and Bill Gates. Indeed, when Buffett spoke to Fox\\nNews about our lunch, he specifically mentioned Mohnish’s charity, remarking,\\n“He thinks as well about philanthropy as he does about investments. . . . This\\nguy has thought a lot about what he’s going to do with the money he makes over\\ntime. He’s going to turn it to the benefit of really, I think, thousands of people. . .\\n. I admire him enormously.”\\nIt was clear that Buffett himself had thought a lot about what to do with his\\nmoney. He talked to us about his thinking in setting up charitable foundations for\\neach of his three children, and he added that “it’s usually not a good idea to\\nwait” to give money back to society: it’s best to go ahead and do it now, he said,\\ninstead of compounding the money and giving a larger sum later. I joked that he\\nwas technically the least wealthy person at the table, since he’d already pledged\\nmost of his Berkshire Hathaway shares to the Bill and Melinda Gates\\nFoundation; as a result, he was now working virtually for free, much like\\nGLIDE’s founder, Cecil Williams. He grinned happily and said that was\\n“absolutely right.” He seemed glad that I understood how little he cares about\\npersonal enrichment and how much he cares about using his wealth to help\\nothers.\\nWhen we thanked Warren for making this lunch possible, he said that he was\\nexcited to do it. For one thing, it gave him a great opportunity to honor Reverend\\nWilliams and also his own late wife, Susan. He said that he had known right\\naway, at 18, that she was the person he wanted to marry, and that he would never\\nhave gotten where he is today without her. He spoke with tender admiration', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='about her kindness, recalling how she had taken terminally ill AIDS patients into\\nher home and given them her own bedroom, seeking to ease their pain in their\\nfinal days. He told Mohnish’s children that choosing the right person to marry\\nwould be the most important decision of their lives.\\nFor three hours, we relished the most wonderfully wide-ranging conversation.\\nFor example, Harina and Mohnish asked Warren about Sir Isaac Newton, since\\nhe had once remarked that Newton was the historical figure with whom he’d\\nmost like to have lunch. He explained to us that Newton was “probably the\\nsmartest human in history” but joked that he’d thought this through some more\\nand would actually prefer to have lunch with Sophia Loren. He said Charlie\\nMunger would most like to share a meal with Ben Franklin, since “Newton was\\nsmarter, but Franklin was wiser.”\\nAt one point, Warren also spoke about a trip he’d taken to China with Bill\\nGates. Cruising up the Yangtze River, they had talked about a man whose job\\nwas to “drag the boats in” when they reached the dock. Warren recalled telling\\nGates that, no matter how smart that guy was, he’d never get a chance to do\\nanything more with his life. He said that, in his own life, it would have been a\\nmajor disadvantage to be born anywhere but the United States since he might not\\nhave read Ben Graham’s The Intelligent Investor, which wasn’t available then in\\nany language but English. He said Graham’s book Security Analysis had been his\\n“holy grail,” and added that he’d been amazed when he then discovered that\\nGraham was teaching at Columbia. Hoping to grab Graham’s attention, he wrote\\nhim a letter that said, “I thought you were dead.”\\nEarly in the conversation, I made a confession: I told Warren how I had\\nchanged my fee structure so that he wouldn’t think I was just another greedy,\\ntwo-and-twenty hedge fund guy. I also mentioned how hard it had been to\\nconvince my fund’s lawyers that this unorthodox approach made sense since it\\nwas fairer to my shareholders. I’ll never forget Warren’s response: “People will\\nalways stop you doing the right thing if it’s unconventional.” I asked if it gets', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='any easier over time to do what’s right. He paused, looked away for a moment,\\nand replied, “A little.”\\nHe then went on to explain how crucial it is to adhere to values that you know\\nto your core are right rather than being swayed by external forces such as peer\\npressure. “It’s very important always to live your life by an inner scorecard, not\\nan outer scorecard,” he said. To illustrate this, he then asked us, “Would you\\nprefer to be considered the best lover in the world and know privately that you’re\\nthe worst—or would you prefer to know privately that you’re the best lover in\\nthe world, but be considered the worst?”\\nAt that moment, I remember thinking, “Yes, that’s true.” But it was only later\\nthat I felt the full force of this advice. In the months that followed, I began to\\nrealize just how much of my life I had spent measuring myself by an outer\\nscorecard. I had always been so eager for people to like and respect me—to win\\nthe plaudits of my professors at Oxford and Harvard, to be seen as a successful\\ninvestment banker and deal maker at D. H. Blair, to be admired as a top-notch\\nfund manager. This neediness had inevitably led me astray. What I really needed\\nwas to measure myself by an inner scorecard. For a start, this would have\\nenabled me to run for my life the moment I realized how toxic it was at D. H.\\nBlair.\\nIt’s hard to overstate the importance of Buffett’s insight. After all, how many\\nof the self-serving excesses and moral compromises that caused the financial\\ncrisis of 2008–2009 would have been avoided if mortgage brokers, bankers, and\\nothers had lived by an inner scorecard? As Warren helped me to understand,\\npeople too often justify their improper or misguided actions by reassuring\\nthemselves that everyone else is doing it too.\\nOne of Buffett’s defining characteristics is that he so clearly lives by his own\\ninner scorecard. It isn’t just that he does what’s right, but that he does what’s\\nright for him. As I saw during our lunch, there’s nothing fake or forced about\\nhim. He sees no reason to compromise his standards or violate his beliefs.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Indeed, he has told Berkshire’s shareholders that there are things he could do that\\nwould make the company bigger and more profitable, but he’s not prepared to do\\nthem. For example, he resists laying people off or selling holdings that he could\\neasily replace with more profitable businesses. Likewise, some investors have\\ncomplained that Berkshire would be much more profitable if he’d moved its tax\\ndomicile to Bermuda as many other insurers have done. But Buffett doesn’t want\\nto base his company in Bermuda even though it would be legal and would have\\nsaved tens of billions in taxes.\\nThis was one of the greatest lessons of our lunch. His strength comes in part\\nfrom this rock-solid sense of who he really is and how he wants to live. There’s\\nno artifice. No need to live according to other people’s standards or opinions.\\nSitting with him at Smith & Wollensky, I could see that he makes no\\ncompromises in terms of his own happiness—even in something as small and\\ninsignificant as his gleeful enjoyment of the restaurant’s desserts. Clearly, he has\\nset up his life so that it suits him and so that he enjoys it. When I asked if he had\\nconsciously created Berkshire’s unique decentralized structure, he emphasized\\nthat it operates that way because it suits his personality, not because it maximizes\\nreturns.\\nAs an investor, he has always remained true to himself. During the tech\\nbubble, when so many other people got carried away, he had no trouble sticking\\nto his principles, even though this meant that he massively underperformed the\\nmarket before it imploded.\\nLikewise, it wasn’t difficult for Buffett to resist the temptation to invest\\nborrowed money, which could have made him richer but could also have landed\\nhim in trouble. Indeed, one of the key lessons of our lunch came when Mohnish\\nasked what had become of Rick Guerin, a friend of Buffett’s whom he had\\nmentioned in his article on “The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville.” For\\na while, Guerin’s investment record had been spectacular. But Warren told us\\nthat Guerin had been “in a hurry to get rich” and had used leverage to juice his', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='returns. When the market crashed in 1973–74, Guerin was hit hard and was\\nforced to sell various holdings, including thousands of shares of Berkshire\\nHathaway that would now be worth a fortune.\\nFor Warren, the travails of this gifted investor clearly provided a powerful\\nexample of the perils of debt and the virtues of patience. “Charlie and I always\\nknew we would become very wealthy,” he told us, “but we weren’t in a hurry.”\\nAfter all, he said, “If you’re even a slightly above average investor who spends\\nless than you earn, over a lifetime you cannot help but get very wealthy—if\\nyou’re patient.”\\nIt helps that Buffett has created a peaceful environment for himself in which\\nhe can operate calmly and rationally. By staying in Omaha, he has remained far\\nfrom the madding crowd. His legendary personal assistant Debbie Bosanek (who\\nhas worked at Berkshire for more than three decades) also helps to shield him\\nfrom unnecessary distractions. She once told Mohnish and me that Warren\\nusually keeps his cell phone switched off and doesn’t even have an email\\naddress. The fact that he has the right filters clearly helps him to guard against\\nletting in the wrong type of information.\\nIndeed, for all his charm and affability, Buffett doesn’t hesitate to disengage\\nhimself from the world in order to avoid distractions that might impair his\\njudgment. He told us that people often try to convince him to meet them so they\\ncan pitch investments to him, but he’s comfortable saying “no” far more often\\nthan he says “yes”—regardless of their attempts to flatter him. He also told us\\nthat he typically avoids meeting corporate managements, preferring to rely on\\ncompanies’ financial statements.\\nSimilarly, he chooses not to fill his days with distracting meetings. During our\\nlunch, he showed us his appointment diary, which was mostly empty, and said he\\nmanages his schedule himself. By contrast, he said Bill Gates’s calendar is filled\\nwith precise entries like “6:47 shower” and “6:57 shave.” It’s not that one system\\nis better or worse: it’s that Buffett has chosen a system that suits him perfectly,', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='giving him the latitude to think in peace, impervious to the noise that tends to\\ndominate Wall Street. As Buffett taught me, it’s not enough to rely on one’s\\nintellect to filter out this noise: you need the right processes and environment to\\ndo so. For this reason, I decided to move to Zurich just six months after our\\nlunch, knowing that it would be easier for me to remain clearheaded there, far\\nfrom the New York vortex.\\nThankfully, this is one aspect of what Buffett does that other investors can\\nreplicate: we can clone the environment and processes he has created to keep the\\nnoise at bay. For me, this has meant not only moving away from Wall Street, but\\nblocking out other types of noise that would otherwise muddy my thinking. For\\nexample, I totally ignore market predictions and focus instead on investing in\\ncompanies that should grow significantly over the long term. At lunch, I was\\nhappy to admit the extent to which I tried to study and clone Buffett’s actions. I\\nexplained my attitude by telling him a Talmudic story about two students who\\nwere so eager to learn from their rabbi that they even slipped under his bed to\\nwatch him at night. Warren joked that he’d be checking under his bed from now\\non to see if I was hiding there.\\nBut there is at least one aspect of Buffett that is entirely inimitable: his\\nbrainpower. During our lunch, I felt that his mind was operating on about five\\ndifferent levels simultaneously. His biographer Alice Schroeder has since\\ndescribed a similar feeling in his presence. It’s hard to explain. But when I sat at\\nthe table with Buffett that day, I felt the sheer intensity of his mind and simply\\nknew that he was operating at a much higher clock speed than I was. In the past,\\nhaving come top of my class at Oxford, I’d somehow convinced myself that I\\nhad the mental capacity to compete with him, and I had hoped that I might one\\nday learn to perform equally well. Seeing him in person that day, I was left with\\nno doubt at all that I could never hope to match him.\\nThis could have been dispiriting, but I found it weirdly liberating. For me, the\\nlesson was clear. Instead of trying to compete with Buffett, I should focus on the', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='real opportunity, which is to become the best version of Guy Spier that I can be.\\nIt reminded me of an old joke that Warren likes to tell: “How do you beat Bobby\\nFisher?” Answer: “Play him at anything other than chess.”\\nI couldn’t beat Warren at his own game. But I could certainly follow his\\nexample. What impressed me most about him that day was not just his mental\\nfirepower, but the fact that he lived in a way that was totally congruent with his\\nown nature. Nothing seemed to be misaligned. He had evidently spent his life\\ntrying to be true to himself.\\nThis became my own goal: not to be Warren Buffett, but to become a more\\nauthentic version of myself. As he had taught me, the path to true success is\\nthrough authenticity.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='THE FINANCIAL CRISIS', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Into the Void\\nValue investors pride themselves on being able to buy when the market is\\nimploding. We like to think that we possess the calmness, courage, and strength\\n—not to mention the intellectual clarity and understanding—to act rationally\\nwhen almost everyone else is panicking. But what really happens when the\\nmarket crashes and there’s blood in the streets? I would find this out firsthand in\\n2008–2009 when the financial world tumbled into the void, dragging me and my\\nfund with it. As Warren Buffett has said, if you weren’t scared, you weren’t\\npaying attention. God knows I was scared.\\nThe experience of the crash was sufficiently painful that it’s difficult for me\\neven now to write about it in a totally honest and forthright way. This isn’t a\\nconscious decision. There are memories from that time that I’ve no doubt\\nsuppressed because they are almost too wrenching to face. William Green, a\\nfriend and shareholder who is helping me to write this book, recently reminded\\nme of a call we had back then in which I told him, only half joking, “We’re\\nbleeding from every orifice.” I have no recollection of this at all. Still, there are\\ncertain moments from that time that are unforgettable even if I would prefer to\\nforget them.\\nOne of the worst of those moments came with the delivery of the Financial\\nTimes one morning in March 2008. Over breakfast, I read on the front page that\\nBear Stearns was teetering on the brink of insolvency. My fund was a brokerage\\nclient of Bear Stearns, and the firm held all of our assets in various accounts. I\\nremember my wife, Lory, exploding at me because I was so distracted and had\\nbeen totally ignoring my family. I turned to her and said: “Don’t you get it? All\\nof Aquamarine’s money is in Bear Stearns. It could all disappear tomorrow.”', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='I spent much of that weekend in my office, researching the names of experts\\nwho, come Monday, could advise me on what it would mean for the fund if Bear\\nStearns went bankrupt. I needed to know what would happen to our accounts,\\nwhether it was possible that they could be frozen for years while a bankruptcy\\ntrustee sifted through the rubble of the firm.\\nAs a conservative, risk-averse investor, I had intentionally placed all of our\\nsecurities in Bear Stearns cash accounts that were fully owned by our fund. I\\nknew that borrowing money and investing on margin can be catastrophic since a\\nbrokerage firm can then take control of the assets in a margin account and sell\\nthem at the worst possible moment. This is effectively what had happened years\\nearlier to Long-Term Capital Management.\\nI had been maniacally focused on avoiding such risks, acutely aware that I\\nneeded to protect our assets, and I didn’t have a single cent of leverage or debt—\\neither personally or in the fund.

I knew that I wasn’t in\\ncontrol, that my fate was in the hands of Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, and other\\npolicymakers whose sole interest, rightly, was to protect the global financial\\nsystem—not me, my fund, or my investors. Potentially, almost all of my family’s\\nnet worth was at risk, along with the savings of dozens of friends, relatives, and\\nbusiness associates. Even so, in this moment of crisis I felt strangely calm.\\nAll of a sudden, my Bloomberg monitor came to life, lighting up with a news\\nflash that JPMorgan Chase had decided to acquire Bear Stearns. I reached for the\\nphone and called my father to share the news. Later that evening, I dialed into a', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='conference call and listened with overwhelming relief to Jamie Dimon’s\\nassurance that JPMorgan “stands behind Bear Stearns . . . guaranteeing [its]\\ncounter-party risk.” Never have such prosaic words meant so much to me. Even\\nas I write this, I feel a wave of emotion.\\nThe Bear Stearns bullet, which I had not even known to exist until a few days\\nearlier, had come appallingly close. But we had been saved. I’ve never met\\nJamie Dimon, but I’ve sent him a Christmas card every year since. I once saw\\nhim at a cocktail party in Davos and didn’t speak to him, but I was tempted to go\\nover to him and give him a hug.\\nAnother ordeal that is seared into my memory occurred in September 2008.\\nWe had just returned from a wonderful family vacation in Europe. Lory and I\\nhad recently had our third child, and we were happily ensconced in a new\\napartment on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. Then, on that sunny September\\nafternoon, my father phoned me out of the blue to ask if I thought Lehman\\nBrothers would go bankrupt. Most of his money was invested in the Aquamarine\\nFund. But it turned out that he had also stashed a sizeable chunk of his liquid\\nassets in Lehman Brothers bonds. Now it looked like Lehman was in a death\\nspiral.\\nI was almost speechless. We had recently escaped disaster with Bear Stearns—\\nand now this? I paced around my living room, listening to my father in disbelief.\\n“Lehman Brothers bonds? You bought Lehman bonds! Why?”\\nI couldn’t imagine how he could possibly have stepped into this minefield.\\nLess than a year earlier, I had listened to a superb presentation on Lehman by\\nDavid Einhorn at the Value Investing Congress. He had picked apart the bank’s\\nfinancial statements to show just how vulnerable it was, so I knew not to touch it\\nwith a ten-foot pole. Yet I now discovered that my own father had invested a\\nsignificant sum in Lehman bonds without thinking to tell me.\\nHe explained that a financial adviser from one of the world’s largest and most\\nprominent banks had called him up to recommend these bonds, assuring him that', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='they had a triple-A rating from Moody’s. He had felt particularly confident in\\nbuying them because he was aware that Moody’s was one of my holdings, and\\nhe knew that I invested in companies with good products.\\nBut I understood exactly how this game worked. Professional investors were\\nfleeing from Lehman in droves. So the Wall Street selling machine had kicked\\ninto high gear, touting this dross to overly trusting clients. With Lehman’s usual\\ninvestors shunning its bonds, the firm had to seek out a more gullible client base.\\nMy father’s bank no doubt pocketed a fat commission as a reward for abusing\\nhim to serve its own ends.\\nI let loose an angry tirade. “How many times have I said that one should never\\nbuy anything that’s being sold by Wall Street? Never. I like Moody’s business,\\nnot their ratings. They always lag the market.” As I spoke, it felt as if my throat\\nwas burning.\\nMy father wanted to know if he should get rid of the bonds, which were now\\nbeing quoted at around 34 cents on the dollar. “Yes,” I said. “Sell them now.”\\nBut it turned out that there was no liquidity at all, and his order was never\\nexecuted. A few days later, on September 15, Lehman filed for Chapter 11. It\\nwas the biggest bankruptcy in US history.\\nI felt angry and humiliated. A big part of my identity is wrapped up in an\\nimage of myself as the protector and builder of wealth for my family and friends.\\nI’d failed, and I was hurt that my father had inadvertently disempowered me by\\nneglecting to inform me before he bought the bonds. But this wasn’t just a blow\\nto my ego. It also rattled me because it made me wonder what else I didn’t know\\nand what other chinks there were in my armor.\\nI had assumed that my defenses were totally solid, but I was starting to sense\\nthat this wasn’t the case. For one thing, my father was easily the largest investor\\nin my fund. The fact that he had been duped into buying Lehman bonds could\\nhave a serious knock-on effect. With the market crashing, I had a long-awaited\\nopportunity to be a dispassionate buyer of companies whose shares had plunged', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='to ridiculously low prices. I knew that I had to pick my spots, but I had spent\\nenough time studying economic history and investors like Buffett to know that\\nthis might well be the best time in my entire life to buy stocks.\\nTo do this, I needed my investors—especially my father—to stay calm during\\nthe storm. If his liquid assets were getting eroded, it would be that much harder\\nfor me to go against the crowd and continue buying while almost everyone else\\nwas in a panic. Knowing that my shareholders were facing these emotional and\\nfinancial pressures placed an additional mental burden on me at a moment when\\nI needed to be icily analytical.\\nThe pressure intensified in other ways that I could never have predicted. For\\nexample, at the time, I employed a bright, hard-working equity analyst whom I\\nregarded as a dependable ally. Then, one day in the fall of 2008, he came into my\\noffice, which I had come to think of as my bunker, and told me that he’d sold all\\nof the stocks in his personal brokerage account. “I’ve gone to cash,” he said.\\n“I’m going to wait till things settle down and the outlook is clearer.”\\nI was stunned. “Are you out of your mind?” I asked, unable to conceal my\\ndisgust. Here was a guy who had proudly claimed to be a value investor and\\nwhom I was paying to be rational. He was supposed to be a like-minded soul,\\nhelping me to seize these incredible opportunities that the market was gifting us.\\nYet his emotions were so out of control that even he was getting swept up in the\\npanic. He just couldn’t take it anymore. This is a measure of how acute the stress\\ncan become at a time like this—even for an intelligent and level-headed analyst\\nwho had previously come up with some highly profitable investments for the\\nfund.\\nI would later decide never to hire another analyst, preferring not to expose my\\nown mind to these insidious distortions. As usual, I should have done a better job\\nof cloning Warren and Mohnish, neither of whom employed a full-time analyst.\\nNeedless to say, they were both buying cheap assets hand over fist at precisely\\nthe moment when weaker-minded investors were seeking the emotional comfort', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='of cash.\\nAs the global financial crisis deepened, the turmoil was unbelievable. Yet the\\nbursting of the housing bubble was hardly a surprise to me. A few years earlier, I\\nhad paid close attention when Buffett explained at a Berkshire annual meeting\\nwhy he no longer owned Freddie Mac: he and Munger had spotted the early\\nwarning signals when lending standards and accounting disclosures began to\\ndeteriorate beyond their comfort level. I had also read some brilliant investment\\nletters by the hedge fund manager Michael Burry in which he cogently explained\\nwhy there would be a disaster in housing and related financial markets. This is\\nan important benefit of remaining in the right intellectual environment:\\nclearheaded investors like Einhorn, Buffett, Munger, and Burry had helped to\\nkeep my eyes wide open.\\nAs a result, I steered well away from the greatest danger areas. I shunned all\\nhousing-related businesses, including any company that financed them. Instead,\\nmy fund owned things like gas pipeline companies, which were about as far\\naway from housing as I could get. Drilling for shale gas was a big growth\\nmarket, and pipelines provided the cheapest mode of transportation from the gas\\nfields to end users.\\nI did own some financial stocks, but I was certain that they were safe and had\\naccess to the liquidity they needed. For example, MasterCard didn’t participate\\ndirectly in the capital markets, and it provided one of the two dominant payment\\nsystems in the world. The closest my portfolio got to the epicenter of the crisis\\nwas Moody’s, which had rated instruments that helped to fuel it. But Moody’s\\nbalance sheet wasn’t at risk; it was merely issuing an opinion about the credit\\nworthiness of different companies rather than providing a guarantee. And there\\nwere plenty of precedents to show that they couldn’t be held liable for\\nexpressing an opinion.\\nI had worked hard to invest in companies that sold for significantly less than\\ntheir intrinsic value. All of them had high-quality moats, and they were all', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='prodigious cash generators. None were highly leveraged or needed regular\\naccess to capital markets. The credit crisis was dangerous for any company that\\nwas leveraged and needed continuous access to money, whereas the long-term\\nhealth of my companies looked remarkably sound. So when I first heard the\\nnews that Lehman was imploding and that liquidity was drying up, it seemed\\nlike a non-issue.\\nBut it turned out that there was really no place to hide, especially for a long-\\nonly investor with a concentrated portfolio like mine, which consisted of around\\n15 stocks. I had successfully piloted the Aquamarine Fund through a number of\\nprevious market corrections, including the Asian crisis of 1997, the dot-com\\ncrash of 1999–2000, and the market jitters that followed September 11, 2001. In\\nthe fund’s first ten years, I had substantially beaten the indexes, quadrupling the\\nmoney of my original investors. My worst year ever had been a 6.7 percent loss\\nin 1999.\\nBut 2008 was something else. I’d never experienced an avalanche like this\\nwithin my portfolio. The serious damage began in June when the fund fell by\\n11.8 percent. The following month, I was down another 3.5 percent. And then\\nthings started to get really ugly. In September, the fund fell by 6.8 percent; in\\nOctober, it plunged by 20.3 percent; and in November, it tumbled by another\\n12.5 percent. For the year as a whole, I was down 46.7 percent. On paper, almost\\nhalf of my shareholders’ money and my family’s money had gone up in smoke.\\nIn the past, I had explicitly warned in my letters to shareholders that it was a\\nstatistical certainty that the fund would one day fall by as much as 50 percent.\\nYou only had to look at the tumultuous history of financial markets to know that\\nthis would eventually happen. The difficulty, of course, is predicting when these\\navalanches will occur. As a long-term investor, my choice—then and now—is\\nnot to attempt to time the market, which strikes me as an impossible task, at least\\nfor me. I also chose not to buy insurance (for example, by shorting an index or\\nbuying puts) since this reduces volatility but lowers your long-term rate of', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='return.\\nFor my temperament, this approach works. Emotionally, 2008 was painful for\\nme. But I could deal with these massive paper losses because I understood that\\nthey didn’t reflect the intrinsic value of my investments. I knew that I’d be fine if\\nI made it through to the other side without being forced to fold by external\\nforces. At some level, I was also making a macroeconomic call that we weren’t\\nheading into a repeat of the Great Depression since we had policymakers who\\nunderstood the risks and were willing to use every available tool to avert\\ndisaster.\\nIt also helped that I had prepared myself for precisely this sort of turmoil. One\\nof the key financial decisions I had made as an adult was that I would never live\\nbeyond my means or fall into debt. The most I’ve ever owed is a few thousand\\ndollars on my credit cards, which I’ve always repaid promptly. I’ve never leased\\na car or taken out a mortgage to buy a house. In 2008, when the market\\nimploded, I was renting an apartment and had enough cash set aside to ride out\\nthe storm.\\nThis attitude toward money is deeply embedded in my family’s psyche. After\\nfleeing from Nazi Germany in 1936, my grandfather used all of the savings he\\ncould take with him—a total of £1,000 in British currency—to build a house in\\nIsrael without borrowing a penny. When my parents moved our family to\\nEngland in 1977, they bought a house in a less-expensive area of London than\\nthey could afford. And when I bought a place in upstate New York, I did it with\\ncash, not debt. My wealthy ancestors had lost their fortune when they were\\nforced to escape from Germany; at some deep-seated level, I live in mortal fear\\nof this happening again. Understanding that this is an integral part of my wiring,\\nI knew that I needed to avoid debt since it would interfere with my ability to act\\nrationally. Likewise, I don’t invest borrowed money because this added stress\\nwould make it impossible for me to remain calm and clearheaded.\\nMy attitude toward debt had also been influenced by Warren Buffett—even', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='before he told us the story of Rick Guerin’s painful experience with leverage. At\\none point, Warren had a mortgage on his home in Omaha, but he’s long since\\npaid it off. In the past, he has also said that he never wants to get into serious\\ndebt because he doesn’t want to discover how he’s capable of behaving. I\\nmentioned to him during our lunch that, when I was growing up in Israel, my\\nparents couldn’t afford to take us on vacation or buy a TV. They would wait\\npatiently until they could afford what they wanted instead of borrowing to buy it.\\nOccasionally, for a treat, we would go for iced coffee at an elegant hotel, the Dan\\nAccadia in Herzliya. It was an inexpensive and prudent way to live the good life.\\nFrom a societal point of view, debt is a vital economic lubricant. Used in\\nmoderation, it’s positively healthy. But for an individual investor, debt can be\\ndisastrous, making it even harder to stay in the game—both financially and\\nemotionally—when the market turns against you.\\nAs Buffett wrote in his 2001 Letter to Shareholders, “You only find out who is\\nswimming naked when the tide goes out.” One of my shareholders was a third-\\nparty marketer who had previously persuaded me to travel with her to Europe for\\ndog-and-pony shows designed to attract new investors to my fund. She was so\\nkeen on the fund’s long-term value approach that she’d invested $2 million in it\\nherself. But her faith in long-term investing suddenly disintegrated, and she\\ncashed out in January 2009. I was flabbergasted. It wasn’t clear if she couldn’t\\nbear the pain or if she was desperate for cash because she simply couldn’t afford\\nthe losses we were suffering. What was clear was that her despair was an almost\\nperfect signal that we had reached the point of maximum pessimism. A few\\nmonths later, the markets bottomed and began to climb.\\nAll but one of my institutional investors also bailed out, partly because they\\nhad a need for liquidity themselves. Still, the vast majority of my shareholders\\nstayed firm, trusting that things would turn around. Most important, my father—\\nwho had faced life-threatening dangers as an Israeli soldier—remained\\nextraordinarily calm. At the height of the crisis, when nearly half of his life', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='savings had been vaporized, he asked me if he should withdraw some money\\nfrom the fund. I said it was the worst possible moment to sell stocks, and I told\\nhim that I’d rather live in a shack than take any cash off the table.\\nTo his eternal credit, he didn’t withdraw a dime, even though he could have\\nyanked out his money at short notice. His stake was large enough that he could\\neffectively have shut down my business. But he never lost confidence in me. In\\nretrospect, I realize that I was standing on the shoulders of a giant. Without his\\nstrength as a silent partner, I wouldn’t have succeeded.\\nFor fund managers, this whole issue of shareholder redemptions can be fraught\\nwith stress and difficulty. Before the crisis, my fund had about $120 million in\\nassets under management. The market crash had slashed this to barely $60\\nmillion. To make matters worse, shareholders redeemed around $10 million\\nmore. One reason was that my fund’s 90-day notice period made it a relatively\\neasy asset to liquidate. Some other hedge funds actually suspended redemptions,\\ntaking advantage of self-serving clauses buried deep inside their offering\\ndocuments by shrewd lawyers. I found this unconscionable.\\nTo meet my investors’ redemption requests, I had to be a net seller of stocks in\\nan environment where they had never looked so cheap. By bailing out at this\\ninopportune moment, a small minority of my investors made it far more difficult\\nfor me to act rationally and take advantage of these bargains. Instead, I had to\\nallocate mental energy to the inordinately difficult task of deciding what to sell.\\nThis taught me an important lesson. At that moment, what I most envied about\\nBuffett was not his prodigious intelligence, but his structural advantage: he had\\npermanent capital to invest since Berkshire is a company, not a fund. This meant\\nthat he didn’t have to worry at all about how to meet shareholder redemptions.\\nAs a result, he was free to make enormous investments in equities at the perfect\\nmoment. According to Warren, temperament is more important than IQ when it\\ncomes to investing. This is no doubt true. But I’m convinced that having a\\nstructural advantage is even more important.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='As for Mohnish, he had set up his fund so that investors could redeem shares\\nonly once a year. His investment losses in the market meltdown were even worse\\nthan mine. But he had to deal with redemption requests only once during the\\nfinancial crisis, at the end of 2008. This structural advantage gave him more\\nlatitude than I had to think clearly about his portfolio. By contrast, the majority\\nof my investors still owned a share class that allowed them to redeem quarterly.\\nTen years had passed since I founded the fund with this structure; now, after all\\nthis time, I was paying the price for my mistake. It was a potent reminder of how\\nimportant it is to create the right structure from the very beginning.\\nIn the midst of the crisis, I also envied Warren for his physical detachment\\nfrom Wall Street and the investment herd. Unlike most professional investors, he\\nseemed perfectly insulated from the fear and irrationality that had gripped the\\nmarket. His small low-key office in Omaha is located in Kiewit Plaza, which he\\nshares with the Kiewit Corporation, a contractor that builds infrastructure such\\nas roads, bridges, and tunnels. It’s an ideal spot for a contrarian investor to think\\ndispassionately about where the crowd might be going wrong.\\nMy own office—in Manhattan’s Carnegie Hall Tower—was a terrible place to\\nbe in the midst of a financial crash. New York was at the heart of the crisis. And\\nthe building itself was filled with fearful investment professionals, including\\nmany hedge fund managers who were getting clobbered. Every morning I’d take\\na bus to work, no longer feeling that I should blow a few dollars on a cab. I\\nwould pass through the glass doors into the building’s impressive lobby, which\\nexudes an atmosphere of understated opulence. When I’d first moved into this\\nskyscraper, I had felt like a Wall Street king. But now, it felt more as if I were\\nentering a hospital. The faces all around me were drawn and pensive. This might\\nsound overstated, but these expressions reminded me most of the looks I had\\nseen on people’s faces as they walked uptown through Manhattan on 9/11.\\nWhen I reached my office on the 25th floor, the mood was grim. In those\\nbrutal months, my employees were quieter and more serious than usual. There', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='was no cheery banter. Nobody wanted to talk. While nothing was explicitly\\nmentioned, they were clearly worried about their paychecks, and they were all\\ndusting off their résumés. In the past, I’d mostly kept the door to my corner\\noffice ajar. Increasingly, I now closed it behind me, consciously trying to keep\\nthe outside world at bay so that this palpable gloom didn’t infect my thinking.\\nLooking back now on the financial crisis, I’m pleased at how well I kept my\\nemotions in check. By then, I had a sufficiently strong emotional core that I\\ndidn’t get swept away by all of these intense pressures. It also helped that I was a\\ntrue believer in the enduring power of value investing. This approach had\\nworked for me for a decade, and I had absolutely no doubt that it would continue\\nto work for me over the long term—if only I could stay the course.\\nStill, it wasn’t easy to remain calm and positive. One way that I coped with the\\nstress was to apply a strategy I had learned from Tony Robbins: studying heroes\\nof mine who had successfully handled adversity, then imagining that they were\\nby my side so that I could model their attitudes and behavior. One historical\\nfigure I used in this way was the Roman emperor and Stoic philosopher Marcus\\nAurelius. At night, I read excerpts from his Meditations. He wrote of the need to\\nwelcome adversity with gratitude as an opportunity to prove one’s courage,\\nfortitude, and resilience. I found this particularly helpful at a time when I\\ncouldn’t allow myself to become fearful.\\nI also tried to imagine how Sir Ernest Shackleton would have felt in my shoes.\\nHe had made grievous mistakes on his great expedition to Antarctica—for\\nexample, failing to land his ship, Endurance, when he could and then\\nabandoning his first camp too soon. Yet he succeeded in putting these errors\\nbehind him, and he ultimately saved the lives of everyone on his team. This\\nhelped me to realize that my own mistakes were an acceptable part of the\\nprocess. Indeed, how could I possibly pilot the wealth of my friends and family\\nwithout making mistakes or encountering the occasional storm? Like\\nShackleton, I needed to see that all was not lost and to retain my belief that I', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='would make it through to the other side.\\nWith this support from the eminent dead, I managed to keep my wits about\\nme. I quietly went over my portfolio again and again, double-and triple-checking\\nto be sure that my holdings had the wherewithal to survive. Confident of my\\nanalysis, I refused to sell a single share of major investments such as American\\nExpress. By March 2009, its stock had plummeted to around $10. I held on and\\nrode it to a nine-fold gain in the years that followed.\\nOnly one of my holdings seemed too risky to keep: CarMax, a seller of\\nsecondhand vehicles. Its stock had already halved, but I was worried that the\\nbusiness model might be broken, given how difficult it had become for car\\nbuyers to obtain low-cost financing. Ultimately, I was proved wrong, and even\\nCarMax bounced back. In this case alone, I had allowed the fears of the market\\nto affect my rational thinking. It was a healthy reminder that I’m not immune to\\nirrational fears, however carefully I try to guard against them.\\nAt the same time, I was also buying some incredibly cheap stocks, despite the\\nburden of meeting shareholder redemptions. For example, I invested in London\\nMining PLC, which was selling at a discount to the value of its cash. I loaded up\\non Brookfield Office Properties, which owned prime real estate that was being\\nvalued at way below its replacement cost. I bought stock in Cresud, an\\nArgentinean owner of large tracts of valuable farmland, which I was getting for\\nfree since the whole company was selling for less than the value of its stake in\\nIRSA, a publicly traded real estate firm. I also invested in Fortescue Metals\\nGroup, which had developed exceptionally low-cost reserves of seaborne iron\\nore. The price of iron ore had collapsed, but I was certain that Chinese demand\\nwould continue to grow.\\nThese were elegant ideas. Not only were they remarkably cheap, but they each\\nhad catalysts that would inevitably emerge. Also, they didn’t just have powerful\\nearnings engines but also substantial collateral value. So the odds of success\\nwere exceptionally high.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='All of these investment ideas emerged from conversations that I had with\\nMohnish, and I benefited immeasurably from his analytical brilliance. His\\nthoughts and insights came at me thick and fast, and I was sometimes slow on\\nthe uptake. Mohnish joked that I seemed to be “drinking from a fire hydrant.”\\nOur growing friendship was one of the most precious rewards of the Buffett\\nlunch, since that rich experience drew Mohnish and me so much closer together.\\nI was amazed by his generosity in sharing his unconventional wisdom with me,\\nand it’s hard to do justice to his importance in helping me to make the right\\ninvestments throughout the credit crisis.\\nAll in all, it was like shooting fish in a barrel. Over the next few years, as the\\nglobal economy recovered and normality slowly returned, every one of these\\nstocks soared. For example, Brookfield doubled, Cresud tripled, and London\\nMining quadrupled. As I had thought at the time, the financial crisis may well\\nhave been a once-in-lifetime opportunity.\\nOn the investing front, I’d acquitted myself well. My core stock-picking\\nprocess was good. But I could see that there were still fundamental things that I\\nneeded to change about how I ran the fund and, for that matter, how I ran my\\nlife. The financial crisis had shown me that investment success isn’t just a matter\\nof identifying great stock ideas. As I had learned through painful experience, I\\nalso had to create the best possible environment for myself—physically,\\nintellectually, and emotionally—so that I could operate more effectively and\\nmake myself less vulnerable to the sort of negative influences I’d encountered\\nduring the financial crisis.\\nLike Warren and Mohnish, I needed to be more strategic in the way I\\nconstructed this environment. I couldn’t clone their intelligence, but I could see\\nwith increasing clarity that I needed to clone the aspects of their environment\\nthat had given them such a structural advantage.\\nSo I decided to hit the reset button. Among the biggest changes I would make:\\nleaving New York for Zurich in the summer of 2009.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='MY OWN VERSION OF OMAHA', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Creating the Ideal Environment\\nOne of the biggest challenges for any investor is that there are so many forces\\nthat mess with our minds. We like to think of ourselves as rational creatures—\\nwhich, to some extent, we are—but the truth is a little murkier. The financial\\ncrisis had demonstrated with brutal efficiency just how irrational investors can\\nbe, especially in extreme situations.\\nThe so-called professionals—myself included—are by no means immune to\\nthese mind-warping distortions. I had witnessed this firsthand as my equity\\nanalyst, my institutional investors, and my third-party marketer all cracked amid\\nthe pressure of a market crash, cashing out at precisely the moment when they\\nshould have been buying. It’s reassuring to talk smugly about the “madness of\\ncrowds,” but what about the madness of the intellectual and financial elite? In\\nmy experience, we are capable of the same insanity. Indeed, it’s often people of\\nmy ilk who are driving the craziness.\\nThe mind itself is a confounded thing, woefully ill-suited to the task of\\ninvesting. This is not a science book or a weighty tome about the structure of the\\nbrain, but it’s worth taking a few moments to ponder why it’s so hard to think\\nand invest in a rational manner.\\nPeople often misguidedly regard the brain as one structure: a neocortex that\\nrationally takes in information, computes it, and spits out the answer. Daniel\\nKahneman, a trailblazing psychologist who won a Nobel Prize for economics in\\n2002, describes this aspect of the brain’s processes with the phrase “thinking\\nslow.” For my part, I used to have a deluded image of myself as the equivalent of\\na fighter pilot, intensely focusing on the instrument panel in the cockpit of my\\njet, making optimal decisions and operating in full control of all the aircraft’s', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='levers.\\nMuch of what we do at fine universities is intended to develop this rational,\\nhigher-thinking aspect of our minds. My friend Ken Shubin Stein teaches an\\nadvanced investment class at Columbia Business School. It’s a phenomenal\\ncourse that provides an enormous amount of useful insight into the investment\\nresearch process. But all this learning and analysis is based upon the assumption\\nthat, when students graduate, it will be their rational neocortex that makes the\\ninvestment decisions. The problem is that there is also a subrational, instinctive\\npart of the brain—which Kahneman describes with the phrase “thinking fast”—\\nwhere much of our decision making actually takes place.\\nOf course, I’m grossly oversimplifying an endlessly rich subject. If you’d like\\nto research this further, you can read more lucid explanations by people like\\nKahneman, Dan Ariely, Jason Zweig, Joseph LeDoux, and Antonio Damasio.\\nReading works by these and other experts on behavioral finance and\\nneuroeconomics, I became fascinated by the quirks and complexities of our\\ndecision-making processes. For example, the neurologist Benjamin Libet\\nshowed how a decision to take an action originates in the brain before the subject\\nis aware that a decision has been made. Then there was the famous nineteenth-\\ncentury case of Phineas Gage, who had suffered an accident that interfered with\\nonly one part of his brain; he appeared to function normally, but he was unable\\nto make rational decisions.\\nI was also intrigued by research showing how the brain deals with signals that\\narrive at different times: the sight of a person’s lip movements arrives\\ninstantaneously, while the sound they make arrives later, yet we perceive that\\nthese signals occur simultaneously. In other words, our brain constructs our\\nreality, and it may not be doing so in an accurate manner.\\nResearch of this kind helped me to see that the brain is a much less wieldy tool\\nthan we’d like to imagine. For participants in the stock market, one of the\\nbiggest problems is that the subrational, instinctive part of the brain is subject to', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='dire mood swings, including outbreaks of irrational optimism and irrational\\npessimism. Indeed, money-related issues often activate the “subrational” parts of\\nour brains. In situations of heightened financial risk, when we feel that we are in\\njeopardy, our subconscious instincts are activated; the neocortex can\\nsubsequently rationalize our decisions.\\nTo understand who we really are as humans (and investors), it also helps to\\nconsider the environment in which we evolved. Roughly speaking, anatomically\\nmodern humans with large brains have been around for about 200,000 years. The\\npart of our brain that evolved most recently is the rational neocortex. But for\\nmuch of our history, we operated in a dramatically different environment. Today\\nthere are substantial parts of our mental apparatus that evolved to help us survive\\nin the wilderness that was home to our hunter-gatherer ancestors. These\\nprimitive survival routines embedded in our brains are easily capable of\\nbypassing the neocortex.\\nWe might like to perceive ourselves as potential Isaac Newtons, but it’s\\nperilous to forget that we also have this other aspect of our nature. Indeed,\\nNewton himself would have been better off if he’d recognized this, given that he\\nwas an infamously dumb investor who lost his life savings in the South Sea\\nBubble. As Newton wryly observed: “I can calculate the movement of stars, but\\nnot the madness of men.”\\nThe problem is not just that our brains are highly irrational. It’s also that the\\neconomic universe operates in ways that are mind-blowingly complicated. The\\nelegant economic theories that I learned at Oxford and Harvard blinded me to\\nthis awesome complexity. A few years after I started investing, the money\\nmanager Nick Sleep introduced me to the Santa Fe Institute, a transdisciplinary\\nresearch community. I knew that Bill Miller, a remarkably smart fund manager at\\nLegg Mason, was on the institute’s board. So I started reading some of its\\nresearch papers.\\nThe key idea that I learned is to think of the economy as a complex adaptive', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='system. Economists hate this notion because we can’t model a complex adaptive\\nsystem or use the type of math we’ve been trained to deploy. We also tend to be\\ndrawn to attractive, harmonious, hard-to-learn ideas such as the general\\nequilibrium theory. This theory provides a wonderful account of how the world\\nought to work, and it can be a useful guide for policy makers. But it distorts our\\nperception of reality.\\nPolymath investors like Bill Miller and Charlie Munger were quick to\\nrecognize that these standard economic models of the world are inadequate when\\nit comes to the markets—and to see that models derived from biology may work\\nbetter. Inspired by the Santa Fe Institute, I read Journey to the Ants by Bert\\nHölldobler and Edward O. Wilson. Much of the book is devoted to describing\\nthe different survival strategies used by ant species and to exploring how these\\ndifferent species have coevolved and competed with each other. This one book\\ntaught me more about economics than I’d learned in all my years at university.\\nThat may sound nuts, but it’s true. Why? Because an ant colony, like the\\neconomy, is a complex adaptive system. Reading about ants was a revelation.\\nFor example, it turns out that ant colonies operate by a simple set of basic rules\\nthat enable them to resolve a myriad of difficult survival problems.\\nI realized instantly that I was discovering models that would be useful for me\\nin analyzing the financial and economic world. My thoughts went to Munger and\\nhis latticework of mental models. So I sent him a copy of Journey to the Ants. To\\nmy delight, he replied with a short handwritten note, saying that he had long\\nintended to read the book. Meanwhile, I resolved to spend more time reading\\nbooks about biology. These studies deepened my sense that it’s helpful to think\\nof the economy as an evolving and infinitely complex biological ecosystem.\\nCompanies, like ant species, must adopt strategies that enable them to thrive or\\nthey will be at risk of extinction.\\nAs I soon discovered, other areas of complexity research also provide helpful\\nmodels for how the economic world operates. For example, the Danish', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='theoretical physicist Per Bak coauthored a classic study of sandpiles that showed\\nwhat happens when you keep dropping grains of sand in one area. The resulting\\npile reaches a state of “self-organized criticality”; avalanches then occur, but it’s\\nimpossible to predict either their timing or their size. This model offers\\nintriguing insights into market crashes, which have much in common with these\\navalanches. For investors, the bottom line is to avoid states of self-organized\\ncriticality, which is essentially what occurred in the stock market before the\\ncrash of 2008–2009.\\nThe point is that the neat economic theories I had learned at university didn’t\\ncome close to describing the true complexities of the economy or the financial\\nmarkets. At the same time, I had also come to see that our brains are hopelessly\\nlimited in the face of this overwhelming complexity. This imbalance is a serious\\nproblem for investors. Here we are—with our little irrational brains and our\\noverly simplistic economic theories—somehow hoping to make sense of this\\nunbelievably complex world. What chance do we have?\\nThis isn’t just a case of self-indulgent intellectual theorizing. It’s a very real\\nchallenge for every investor. Is there any way, then, of tilting the balance in our\\nfavor so that we increase the odds of victory in a game that’s so heavily stacked\\nagainst us? This is the question that underlies the next few chapters of this book.\\nIn retrospect, I should have been far more skeptical about the economic\\nmodels I had learned at university. So you’ll be glad to hear that I’m not going to\\nbore you with erudite discussions of the Black-Scholes model of option pricing,\\nKeynesian macroeconomics and sticky prices, the IS/LM macroeconomic model,\\nrational expectations, the Herfindahl industrial concentration ratio, or the\\nRüdiger Dornbusch exchange rate overshooting model.\\nThis is, of course, sexy stuff that might serve you well if you’re looking for\\nlove at a Mensa cocktail party or a gathering of central bankers. It might also get\\nyou a first-class degree and a great teaching gig. But in my experience, it’s not\\nparticularly helpful when it comes to investing. The trouble is, economic', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='theories like these tend to be based on intellectually elegant assumptions about\\nhow the world operates, not on the messy reality in which we actually live.\\nThat said, there are plenty of useful things I learned at university that\\nshouldn’t be junked. For example, it’s indispensable for any serious investor to\\nknow how to read a company’s accounts. This doesn’t mean simply grasping the\\ndifference between cash and accrual accounting. It also involves understanding\\nthe various ways that accounting rules can be used to skew the headline earnings\\nnumbers, not to mention the ability to tell whether the quality of earnings is\\nincreasing or decreasing. If you’ve picked up an MBA or a CFA, you’ve already\\ngleaned the basic mechanics of this type of analysis. If not, there are lots of\\nbooks that can impart this fundamental knowledge, including seminal works by\\nBen Graham and David Dodd, Marty Whitman, John Mihaljevic, Seth Klarman,\\nand Joel Greenblatt. You don’t need me to go over that well-trodden ground\\nagain.\\nUnfortunately, most investment books tend to focus on technical skills. It’s\\nfine to study basic concepts like return on investment, P/E ratios, and the like.\\nBut these things aren’t hard, and they will get you only so far. Anyone who’s\\nsmart enough to make it through business school can figure out how to dissect\\n10Ks, 10Qs, and other financial documents. The real challenge, in my view, is\\nthat the brain itself—which got us to where we are—is the weakest link. It’s like\\na little boat, adrift in a sea of irrationality and subject to unexpected storms. And\\nit’s incompletely understood by even the most brilliant neuroscientists, let alone\\nby investors.\\nWhen I started to read up on behavioral finance and neuroeconomics, there\\nwas a thrilling sense that I was fathoming some of the deepest mysteries of how\\nthe brain functions and malfunctions. But, initially, I mistakenly assumed that I\\ncould rely on my intellectual powers to overcome these irrational tendencies. As\\nI read about the brain’s shortcomings, I would nod knowingly, reassuring myself\\nthat I wouldn’t trip up now that I had a better understanding of where these', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='mental tripwires lay. But I gradually learned that intellectual knowledge and self-\\nawareness are simply not enough. The difficulty is that we can’t use the brain to\\noverride the brain. So we remain vulnerable to these mental shortcomings even\\nwhen we know about them.\\nWhat, then, is the solution? This, I hope, is where I can help you by sharing\\nwhat I’ve learned so far.\\nThrough painful experience—both at D. H. Blair and in the financial crisis—I\\ndiscovered that it’s critical to banish the false assumption that I am truly capable\\nof rational thought. Instead, I’ve found that one of my only advantages as an\\ninvestor is the humble realization of just how flawed my brain really is. Once I\\naccepted this, I could design an array of practical work-arounds based on my\\nawareness of the minefield within my mind.\\nAs it happens, this minefield may be particularly treacherous in my case.\\nAround 2004, a friend who is on the faculty of the Mount Sinai School of\\nMedicine sent me for an examination with his colleague Dr. Mary Solanto. She\\nconducted a battery of tests and concluded that I have attention deficit disorder\\n(ADD). The tests showed that I was capable of periods of extraordinary hyper-\\nfocus, especially at times of high stress, but that I was equally capable of falling\\nthrough attention trapdoors when it came to the more mundane things in life. I\\ncould think great thoughts, but my attention could shift so easily that I had little\\ngrasp of basic things like what time it was or where I’d left my keys.\\nTo deal with my ADD, I needed to develop an array of simple work-arounds—\\nfor example, installing big clocks in my office to help me keep track of time,\\nhaving a clear desk so that I wouldn’t get distracted, and putting objects in the\\nsame places so that I wouldn’t lose them quite so often. In hiring a personal\\nassistant, I specified that a key part of the job was to watch over me so that I\\nwouldn’t mess up simple tasks like catching flights, remembering appointments,\\nor closing the front door when I left our office building.\\nAll of this focus on building work-arounds and circuit breakers into my', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='everyday life proved to be incredibly helpful—not just in dealing with my ADD\\nbut also in becoming a better investor. The truth is, all of us have mental\\nshortcomings, though yours may be dramatically different from mine. With this\\nin mind, I began to realize just how critical it is for investors to structure their\\nenvironment to counter their mental weaknesses, idiosyncrasies, and irrational\\ntendencies.\\nFollowing my move to Zurich, I focused tremendous energy on this task of\\ncreating the ideal environment in which to invest—one in which I’d be able to\\nact slightly more rationally. The goal isn’t to be smarter. It’s to construct an\\nenvironment in which my brain isn’t subjected to quite such an extreme barrage\\nof distractions and disturbing forces that can exacerbate my irrationality. For me,\\nthis has been a life-changing idea. I hope that I can do it justice here because it’s\\nradically improved my approach to investing, while also bringing me a happier\\nand calmer life.\\nAs we shall see in a later chapter, it wasn’t just my environment that would\\nchange. I would also overhaul my basic habits and investment procedures to\\nwork around my irrationality. My brain would still be hopelessly imperfect. But\\nthese changes would subtly tilt the playing field to my advantage. To my mind,\\nthis is infinitely more helpful than focusing on things like analysts’ quarterly\\nearnings reports, Tobin’s Q ratio, or pundits’ useless market predictions—the\\nsort of noise that preoccupies most investors.\\nThe financial crisis had shown me beyond doubt that managing the\\nnonrational part of my brain had to become an integral part of managing my\\nstock portfolio. It also highlighted how hard it was for me to do this in\\nManhattan. We’re all wired a little differently, but New York—with its restless\\nenergy, competitive spirit, and pockets of extreme wealth—accentuated some\\naspects of my own irrational nature that aren’t conducive to good investing. I\\nneeded to be in a place where I could think calmly and invest for the long term\\nwithout the pressure of other people’s expectations or the distraction of all the', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='frenzied activity buffeting me in New York.\\nThis is not to say that it isn’t a fine base for some great investors. David\\nEinhorn has thrived there; so have the managers of the Sequoia Fund. But I\\nsuspect that it’s harder for people like me who flocked to New York from\\nelsewhere and therefore lack the local roots that give emotional stability to\\npeople raised there. For outsiders, it’s too easy to get unbalanced by the\\nunbridled appetites—including greed and envy—that financial centers like New\\nYork and London can inflame.\\nTo borrow a memorable term from Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s book The Black\\nSwan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable, these big cities are “Extremistan.”\\nAs we know from various studies, the disparity between our own wealth and our\\nneighbors’ wealth can play a significant role in determining our happiness. If so,\\nthen reading about a New York–based multibillionaire like the Blackstone\\nGroup’s Stephen Schwarzman may well trigger a destabilizing reaction in my\\nirrational brain. Unless we have robust ways of dealing with these mind-bending\\nforces, we can’t avoid being knocked off course by them. For example, the\\nproximity of so much extreme wealth might make it more tempting for me to\\nswing for the fences with my investments instead of focusing calmly on making\\na decent compounded return without undue risk.\\nFor me at least, it seemed wiser to live in a place where the differences are less\\nextreme. Given my particular set of flaws and vulnerabilities, I figured that I\\nwould stand a better chance of operating somewhat rationally in the kind of\\nplace that Taleb describes as “Mediocristan,” where life is more mundane.\\nSo I started actively to consider alternatives to Manhattan. For a while, I\\nthought seriously of moving to Omaha, given how well it had worked for\\nWarren. I also considered Irvine, California, where Mohnish lives. I\\ncontemplated other American cities like Boston, Grand Rapids, and Boulder.\\nAnd I thought about relatively low-key European cities such as Munich, Lyon,\\nNice, Geneva, and Oxford.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='But in the end, Lory and I agreed on Zurich. I had gone there often as a child\\nand had always liked it. More recently, I’d also read studies in which Zurich was\\nroutinely ranked as the world’s leading city for quality of life. It wasn’t hard to\\nsee why. It’s a small, safe, manageable place with handsome architecture, clean\\nair and water, and superb physical infrastructure. It has good public schools.\\nThere are beautiful mountains and great skiing just minutes away. It also has an\\nexcellent airport, easily accessible from the downtown area, with direct flights to\\nplaces like New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Shanghai, and Sydney.\\nWhile Zurich is an expensive place to live, it’s also highly egalitarian because\\neverybody has access to more or less the same things—from pristine lakes to\\npublic swimming pools that are even better than the private one I’d enjoyed at\\nour fancy country club in upstate New York. Likewise, Zurich’s unsurpassed\\npublic transport system is so efficient that even local billionaires use it. The fact\\nthat the rich don’t exist in an alternate reality that seems way out of reach for\\neveryone else reduces the envy and the sense of lack that it’s easy to feel in cities\\nlike New York and London.\\nI don’t want to suggest that Zurich is perfect, but it has one other trait that\\nseems remarkable to me: it’s genuinely built on trust. For example, on the train\\nsystem, tickets are seldom checked and there are no turnstiles. In stores,\\ncustomers routinely buy wine and other products on credit and have them\\ndelivered to their homes, along with the invoice. Residents are part of a web of\\ndeserved trust, and this tends to bring out the best in them. In a way, this is a\\nBuffettesque view of life. Warren treats the managers of his companies with\\nconsiderable trust, granting them the latitude to make their own decisions, and\\nthey respond by doing everything they can to live up to his expectations.\\nZurich also struck me as a place where I could live in mental peace—a quiet,\\npleasant, slightly bland setting where there isn’t too much going on. Here I could\\nfocus on my family and my fund without undue disturbance. Occasionally\\npeople ask me, “But isn’t it boring there?” My answer: “Boring is good. As an', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='investor, that’s exactly what I want.” Because distraction is a real problem. What\\nI really need is a plain, unobtrusive background that’s not overly exciting. And\\nI’m certainly not alone in finding Zurich conducive to clear thought. Historically,\\nthe city has provided a space for free contemplation to residents as diverse as\\nCarl Jung, James Joyce, Richard Wagner, Vladimir Lenin, and Albert Einstein—\\nnot to mention Tina Turner.\\nIt was also important that in Zurich I wouldn’t be surrounded by people in the\\ninvestment business. This would make it easier to go against the crowd without\\nthe risk that their thinking would seep into my own mind. Zurich is also far\\nenough off the beaten track that not too many people would visit me; the friends\\nand relatives who cared the most would come, but I wouldn’t have to devote too\\nmuch time to relationships that were less central to my life. This might sound\\ncold and unsentimental, but these are the sort of things that I needed to consider\\nas I constructed an environment that suited my idiosyncratic character and\\npriorities. After all, in moving to Zurich I had a chance to start over with a clean\\nslate, putting into practice all that I had learned about how I could function more\\neffectively. I didn’t want to blow it.\\nNext, I set about finding the perfect office—another key component of my\\nnew environment. Initially, I made a mistake, renting an office for a year on the\\nBahnhofstrasse, a ritzy street that is Zurich’s own enclave of Extremistan. It’s an\\nelegant area, full of expensive stores. But super-rich settings like this are not\\nideal for me since they stimulate unhealthy appetites. So I soon decided to move\\nto an office on the other side of the river, a 15-minute walk from the\\nBahnhofstrasse’s glitz and glamour. For me, this feels like a safe distance.\\nThe psychologist Roy Baumeister has shown that willpower is a limited\\nresource, so we have to be careful not to deplete it. In fact, his lab discovered\\nthat even the simple act of resisting chocolate chip cookies left people with less\\nwillpower to perform subsequent tasks. In my case, I don’t want to waste my\\nlimited energy guarding myself against the envy and greed that a place like the', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Bahnhofstrasse might trigger in me. It’s better simply to construct my\\nenvironment so that I’m not exposed to these destabilizing forces, which are\\nlikely to intensify my irrationality. The key is to free my mind from any\\nunnecessary mental effort so I can use it for more constructive tasks that are\\nlikely to benefit me and my shareholders.\\nAs I pondered these issues, I also began to recognize that other investors I\\nadmire had adopted a similar approach to building their environment, whether\\nconsciously or not. Mohnish, for one, works in a less-than-glamorous office park\\nin Southern California with no other financial institutions nearby. I once asked\\nhim why he hadn’t set himself up in an attractive office in one of Irvine’s fancy\\nshopping centers, close to his favorite restaurants. “Oh, Guy,” he replied. “I\\ndon’t need all that razzmatazz!” I have no doubt that he understands what the\\narea around him can do to his mind.\\nLikewise, Seth Klarman, one of the most successful investors on the planet,\\nworks out of a decidedly unflashy office in Boston, far from the intoxications of\\nWall Street. If he wanted, he could easily rent the top floor of a gleaming\\nskyscraper overlooking the Charles River. Nick Sleep set up his office in London\\nnear a Cornish pasty shop on the King’s Road, far from the grandeur of Mayfair,\\nwhich has become Britain’s hedge fund mecca. Allen Benello, the manager of\\nWhite River Investment Partners, works out of a nondescript office in San\\nFrancisco, nowhere near the city’s financial district. And Buffett, as we’ve\\ndiscussed, is tucked away in Omaha’s Kiewit Plaza—another building that is not\\nexactly known for its razzmatazz.\\nThis strikes me as a significant yet largely unrecognized factor in the success\\nof these investors. Small wonder, then, that I wanted to create my own version of\\nOmaha.\\nThat said, I’m different from Buffett—and not just in terms of IQ points. For\\none thing, it’s important for me to have a pleasant view from my office, whereas\\nhe’s not fussed about such aesthetic considerations. While I like to look out on', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='trees or something similarly cheering, he routinely keeps the blinds drawn in his\\noffice. But in other substantive ways, I consciously modeled the environment\\nhe’d created in Omaha. For example, Warren lives about a ten-minute drive from\\nhis office, which is slightly outside the city center. Mohnish’s office in Irvine is\\nalso about ten minutes from his home, and it’s slightly outside the city center. I\\nmirrored them, selecting an office that’s a twelve-minute walk or seven-minute\\ntram ride from my home and that’s slightly outside the city center. For me, it\\nworks to be outside the heart of the city, partly because this makes it less likely\\nthat too many people will drop by the office opportunistically. They need a\\nstronger reason to make this effort, so their visits tend to be more worthwhile.\\nThese decisions were carefully considered. For example, Mohnish and I had\\nspecifically discussed commuting times, reaching the conclusion that the ideal\\ncommute takes around ten to twenty minutes. This is close enough to improve\\none’s quality of life, but far enough to establish a separation between work and\\nhome. For people like me who get obsessive about their jobs, it’s useful to have\\nthis separation. We need to see our families and spend time at home when we’re\\nnot just buried in work. For the same reason, it’s important to have hobbies.\\nAmong other things, I run and ski, which not only makes me healthier and\\nhappier, but clears my mind and strengthens my detachment from the mood\\nswings of the market. If I spent that time holed up in my office, single-mindedly\\nanalyzing stocks, I’m certain that my decision making and my investment\\nreturns would suffer, along with my health and my family life.\\nIn any case, everything is interconnected. My original motivation for creating\\na better environment had been to boost my returns. But these decisions also led\\nto a better life.\\nWithin the office itself, I was equally careful to construct an environment that\\nwould help me to operate rationally and effectively despite my balky wiring.\\nOnce again, it helps to know thyself—and to adapt thy setting accordingly. As\\nI’ve mentioned, one of my flaws is that I’m amazingly easy to distract, and I', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='need to address this problem in designing my physical environment. Unlike\\nBuffett, who can operate brilliantly without a computer or an email address, I\\nrely on my computer. But I’m also aware that the Internet and email can become\\nappalling distractions for me. To counteract this and to help me remain focused, I\\nphysically divided my office.\\nAt one end of the corridor, I have a “busy room,” with a phone, a computer,\\nand four monitors. But I keep the computer and the monitors on an adjustable-\\nheight desk, which I typically position so that I have to stand beside it.\\nResponding to emails is a low mental task, but it’s easy to get sucked into it for\\nlong stretches of time. So I’ve intentionally set up the desk in a way that\\nprevents me from sitting at it. This might seem perverse, but the goal is to create\\nan office that gives me the space to think quietly and calmly. Minor adjustments\\nlike this awkward positioning of the computer help to stack the odds in my favor.\\nAt the other end of the corridor, I have a room that I call the library. Here,\\nthere’s no phone or computer. I want to encourage myself to spend more time\\nsitting and thinking, so this room is designed to be warm and welcoming. I can\\ntake piles of financial documents to study in there or select a book from the\\nshelves that line the walls. If I close the door, it means that nobody is allowed to\\nbother me. The library also serves as a nap room. Not coincidentally, Mohnish\\nalso naps in his office, and Warren told us that he has a place in his office where\\nhe can nap too. This isn’t a matter of sloth—or, at least, not entirely! A daytime\\nsnooze keeps the mind fresh, shuts out the noise, and provides a chance to reboot\\nthe system.\\nTrivial as it might seem, even the way you decorate your office matters. Think\\nof Oxford colleges, where the dining halls are adorned with portraits of\\nillustrious alumni. On some level, their presence sends an inspiring message to\\nthe current flock of students. In a similar way, I positioned a bronze bust of\\nCharlie Munger in my office. I’m not deifying him, but I want to activate his\\npresence in my mind—not least as a cue to remind me of the dangers of those 24', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='forms of misjudgment that he identified in his talk at Harvard. Likewise, I keep\\nphotographs in my busy room and my library that show me with Warren and\\nMohnish on the day of our lunch.\\nI can’t explain all of this on a rigorous scientific level. But my impression is\\nthat mirror neurons help us to model the influential people in our presence. By\\nhaving images of Munger and Buffett in my office, I’m trying once again to tilt\\nthe playing field on a subconscious level, using their presence to influence my\\nthoughts. My sense is that this is quite common. When I visited Winston\\nChurchill’s study at Chartwell, I was struck by the objects he kept on his desk,\\nincluding a bust of Napoleon, a porcelain figurine of Admiral Nelson, and a\\nphotograph of the South African prime minister Jan Smuts. I don’t think they\\nwere there merely for decoration. I’m guessing there were moments when\\nChurchill would ask himself what these famous leaders would do in his\\nsituation. Religious objects such as crucifixes can presumably serve a similar\\npurpose, providing a cue for the devout to improve their behavior. Given the\\npower of mirroring, it’s important to choose our heroes and role models with real\\ncare.\\nI also have photographs in my office of my father and some of my first\\ninvestors, including a couple of his business partners. This is to remind me who\\nI’m working for so that I never lose sight of my responsibility to my\\nshareholders. Lately, I’ve been thinking of commissioning a single photographer\\nto take black-and-white portraits of all my investors.\\nAbout a year after our charity lunch, Warren Buffett generously gave Mohnish\\nand me an impromptu tour of his office in Omaha. I was fascinated to see how\\nhe had structured his own environment to enhance his ability to make rational\\ndecisions. Perhaps the most striking feature of his office was that it contained so\\nlittle that could clutter his mind. He had only two chairs and no space for large\\nmeetings—a practical means of discouraging unnecessary interactions. His\\nwindow shades were closed, presumably helping him to focus on the task at', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='hand.\\nOn the wall behind his desk, Warren had a prominently displayed photo of his\\nfather, Howard Buffett, whom he greatly admires. Lowenstein’s biography of\\nWarren describes Howard as an “unshakably ethical” Congressman who\\n“refused offers of junkets and even turned down a part of his pay. During his\\nfirst term, when the congressional salary was raised from $10,000 to $12,500,\\nHoward left the extra money in the Capitol disbursement office, insisting that he\\nhad been elected at the lower salary.” It’s not hard to see this influence on\\nWarren, whose modest salary for running Berkshire reflects a similar sense of\\nintegrity and altruism. More to the point, the photo is a reminder of how helpful\\nit can be to include images of our role models when we are constructing our own\\nwork environment.\\nAs for Warren’s desk, it was so small that there was no room for piles,\\nobliging him to process his reading efficiently. An in-box and an out-box lay on\\ntop of his desk, along with a box labeled “Too Hard”—a visual reminder that he\\nshould wait patiently until the perfect opportunity arrives. As he puts it, “I will\\nonly swing at pitches I really like.” There’s an element of playfulness about his\\n“Too Hard” box, but its presence must also have a subtle effect on the way he\\nthinks. These cues wouldn’t help much if Buffett didn’t also have an\\nextraordinary mind. But it’s interesting that even a man of his intelligence sees\\nfit to keep that box on his desk as a physical aid that keeps his mind on track. To\\nme, this shows a remarkable humility about his abilities.\\nI also found it telling that there was no Bloomberg terminal in Buffett’s office.\\nApparently, there’s one at the other end of the building, used by a Berkshire\\nemployee who manages a bond portfolio. Buffett could no doubt access it if he\\nwanted to, but he’s consciously chosen not to have this informational fire hose\\nwithin easy reach.\\nLikewise, when I visited Nick Sleep’s office in London, I was intrigued to\\ndiscover that he kept his Bloomberg awkwardly positioned so that he could use it', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='only while sitting on an uncomfortably low chair. Like Buffett, he had\\nconsciously designed his environment to discourage his use of a terminal that\\ncosts more than $20,000 a year to rent. Why? After all, a constant flow of\\ninformation is surely the lifeblood of any professional investor.\\nMy own relationship with the Bloomberg terminal is similarly ambivalent and\\ntortured. It’s a formidable tool, and there are times when I’ve found it helpful as\\na way to get stock data or news in a hurry. In my New York vortex years, my\\nBloomberg subscription also served the dubious purpose of bolstering my ego. It\\nmade me feel like a privileged member of a club that could afford the most\\nexpensive toys; without it, I might not have felt equal to my peer group. But\\nbeyond this foolishness, there’s also a more serious downside to using a\\nBloomberg—or, for that matter, rival systems sold by companies like Reuters\\nand FactSet.\\nAll of these products—but especially the coveted, top-of-the-line Bloomberg\\n—are ingeniously designed to lure the subscriber with the seductive promise of\\nnonstop information. The terminal delivers such a relentless flood of news and\\ndata into investors’ brains that it’s hard to muster the self-discipline to turn off\\nthe spigot and concentrate on what matters most. You see stock tickers flashing\\nbefore your eyes, news alerts blaring for your attention. Everything links to\\nsomething else, so you often find yourself ricocheting into deeper and deeper\\nrecesses within this informational netherworld.\\nInitially, I was totally hooked. In my early years as a money manager, I would\\narrive in my Manhattan office and immediately fire up my Bloomberg. It would\\nlight up like a Christmas tree, its bright colors subconsciously spurring its users\\nto action. But as I became more self-aware, I began to realize that this call to\\naction wasn’t helping me at all; nor were the endless hours of information\\nsurfing. I started to ask myself, “Is this really the best and highest use of my\\nattention?” If I have only a limited amount of willpower, how much of it should I\\nsquander in trying to resist the temptation to snack on all of this informational', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='sugar?\\nDuring the financial crisis, I saw more clearly than ever what an unhealthy\\naddiction the Bloomberg had become. The constant barrage of bad news could\\neasily have exacerbated my irrational tendencies, when what I needed most was\\nto screen out the noise and focus on the long-term health of my portfolio. So I\\nwent cold turkey. In late 2008 and early 2009, as the market collapsed, I turned\\nthe monitor off for days on end. Another tactic that I used to distance myself\\nfrom the Bloomberg was to stop having a personal login, though we still had a\\ncompany login. I also changed the color scheme on my home screen so that it\\nwas dull and muted, thereby minimizing the risk that all those bright, flashing\\ncolors might jolt my irrational brain into unnecessary action.\\nIn setting up my office in Zurich, I had to decide once again how to tackle the\\nBloomberg conundrum. By now, I was used to having the service.\\nPsychologically, it would have been painful to let it go. I also knew that\\noccasionally it was extraordinarily useful. But I was equally aware that, for me,\\nit did more harm than good. So, in the end, I came to an uneasy compromise. I\\nrelegated the Bloomberg to the adjustable-height desk in my busy room. The fact\\nthat the desk is adjusted so that I usually have to stand means that there’s little\\ndanger that I’ll be tempted to use the Bloomberg for hours, grazing in a state of\\nhelpless distraction. Nowadays, I often go weeks without turning on the\\nBloomberg at all. Still, it’s there if I ever need it—my own exceptionally\\nexpensive version of a toddler’s security blanket.\\nOf course, the rational part of my brain tells me that I’d be better off getting\\nrid of the Bloomberg entirely. Why bother paying more than $20,000 a year for a\\ndistraction that I can so easily do without? But I accept my fallibility. Instead of\\npretending to be perfectly rational, I find it more helpful to be honest with\\nmyself about my irrationality. At least then I can take practical steps that help me\\nto manage my irrational self. Perhaps this is the best that any of us can do.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='LEARNING TO TAP DANCE', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='A New Sense of Playfulness\\nIn moving to Zurich, I decided that I needed to change other aspects of my life\\ntoo.

One of the\\ncleverest investors I knew, a guy from the year above me at Harvard, lost 80', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='percent and had to close his fund. He was still in his early 40s, but his once-\\nglittering career as an investor was apparently finished. For me, the crash was\\nthe investing equivalent of a near-death experience. It forced me to reappraise\\nhow I wanted to live and what was truly important to me.\\nAmid this soul-searching, I began to see that I had locked myself into a view\\nof my career as a life-or-death struggle. My approach was simply too extreme: I\\ndidn’t just want to be a great investor, but to be Warren Buffett. For so many\\nyears, I had driven myself in an almost maniacally focused way to achieve my\\ngoals, acting as if my exam results, my university performance, and my fund’s\\ninvestment returns were everything, as if they defined who I was and determined\\nmy value.\\nPerhaps this stemmed from the ethos of my English education. At the age of\\n11, I had gone off to a British boarding school as an immigrant misfit who had\\nalready lived in Iran, Israel, and South Africa. Everything at school was a\\nstruggle for me, and I felt at the time that it was all about survival. In a sense, I\\ncarried this attitude blindly into my adult life, seeing my investing career as a\\nkind of gladiatorial contest. In the wake of the financial crisis, I belatedly\\nrecognized that this tendency to approach life as a battle to the death was not\\nnecessarily useful, let alone a recipe for happiness.\\nI needed to lighten up. Figuratively at least, I wanted to learn to tap dance.\\nAs part of this reinvention of myself, I was determined to have a lot more fun.\\nOne aspect of this was that I began to travel more. In 2009, for example, I took a\\nten-day trip to India with Mohnish. In the past, I would never have embarked on\\nan adventure like this. I had felt obliged to work nonstop, so I would have\\nconvinced myself that I needed to stay home and watch over my stock portfolio.\\nBut I went to India with no agenda, and it turned out to be a marvelously\\nenriching experience, helping me to see the world anew.\\nAmong other things, I got to observe the remarkable work that Mohnish’s\\nDakshana Foundation is doing to help educate kids on an industrial scale. It', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='might sound like a platitude, but it also affected me deeply to see how happy\\nmany people were in India, despite having so little on a purely material level. It\\nhelped me to recognize how twisted our values can become in richer countries.\\nAnd then there was the fascination of watching Mohnish in a nonprofessional\\nsetting, of seeing up close how he’s wired. For me, there were lessons simply\\nfrom observing his reaction to missed appointments and to people who behaved\\nbadly. I’ve seldom encountered anybody with his blend of calm and rational\\nequanimity.\\nOn that same trip, we also attended a TEDIndia conference in Mysore. I loved\\nit. In the years that followed, I cofounded the TEDxZurich conference, attended\\nevents like the Art Basel show in Switzerland, and got more involved with\\nsupporting institutions such as Oxford, Harvard, and the Weizmann Institute of\\nScience in Israel. I don’t know if these things have made me a better investor,\\nbut they have certainly broadened my thinking, brought me many interesting\\nrelationships, and invigorated my life. Equally important, these activities are\\nanother aspect of being true to myself and who I am.\\nMeanwhile, in Zurich, I consciously avoided certain types of people. As I’ve\\nmentioned, living in Switzerland and basing myself outside the city center made\\nit harder for the “wrong” people to visit me. They needed a good reason to make\\nthe effort, and this acted as a useful filtering mechanism. Moving to Zurich also\\nallowed me to cut through the whole Gordian knot of my unhealthy relationships\\nwith fund marketers, equity analysts, and other professional “helpers” who had\\nunhelpfully oriented me toward a standard, New-York-hedgie model of life.\\nBut I wasn’t looking to become a shut-in. On the contrary, I was increasingly\\nwilling to invest large amounts of time and money to travel anywhere to see\\npeople who were important to me. I went to Israel with Ken Shubin Stein. I flew\\nto California to spend a few days with Mohnish, again with no agenda other than\\nthe pleasure of hanging out with a person I like and admire. Mohnish and I also\\nset up a mastermind group of eight people, the Latticework Club, which meets', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='every few months to share what’s going on in our lives and to support one\\nanother. This group has helped me to open up emotionally and to introspect in a\\nmore systematic way.\\nFor good measure, I also teamed up with my friend John Mihaljevic to create\\nan annual event in Switzerland called VALUEx—a community of like-minded\\npeople who share investment ideas and wisdom while also forging friendships\\nover meals and on the ski slopes of Klosters. In 2014, more than 70 people\\nflocked to Switzerland from around the world to join us at VALUEx.\\nI had always enjoyed sports. But after moving to Zurich, I embraced them\\nwith more enthusiasm than ever. I ran or biked a few days a week, and I took my\\nkids skiing on weekends.\\nLikewise, I rediscovered my love of games, not least because the financial\\ncrisis had given me a renewed appreciation for how important it is to be playful\\nand not to take myself too seriously. I’d started to play bridge around 2007,\\nprompted by Mohnish, who is an ardent player, and by the example of Buffett,\\nMunger, and Bill Gates, all of whom are bridge fanatics. Initially, I joined the\\nManhattan Bridge Club and started taking lessons. Once I’d learned the basics, I\\nquickly realized that bridge was not only a pleasurable diversion but would help\\nto hone my skills in life, not to mention investing.\\nIndeed, as a preparation for investing, bridge is truly the ultimate game. If I\\nwere putting together a curriculum on value investing, bridge would\\nundoubtedly be a part of it. As I began to discover the subtleties of the game, I\\nwas reminded of an intriguing comment that Charlie Munger had made about\\ninvesting in his lecture on the causes of human misjudgment: “The right way to\\nthink is the way that Zeckhauser plays bridge. It’s just that simple. And your\\nbrain doesn’t naturally know how to think the way Zeckhauser knows how to\\nplay bridge.” Richard Zeckhauser is a professor of political economy and a\\nchampion bridge player who chairs the Investment Decisions and Behavioral\\nFinance Executive Program at Harvard. An expert on economic behavior in', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='acutely uncertain situations, he has authored papers with titles like “Investing in\\nthe Unknown and Unknowable.”\\nFor investors, the beauty of bridge lies in the fact that it involves elements of\\nchance, probabilistic thinking, and asymmetric information. When the cards are\\ndealt, the only ones you can look at are your own. But as the cards are played,\\nthe probabilistic and asymmetric nature of the game becomes exquisite. For\\nexample, during the bidding, I might ask myself a question like this: “Given that\\nthe player to my right has bid two clubs, how does that update my probabilistic\\nassessment of what cards he’s holding?” As play continues, I might find myself\\nthinking, “Aha, my partner has just led with the ace of spades. That must mean\\nthat she’s also got a king or is short spades.”\\nIn investing, we constantly operate with limited information. For example, not\\nso long ago, Mohnish and I researched a Chinese manufacturer of cars and\\nbatteries, BYD Auto. What initially triggered our interest was a story in the Wall\\nStreet Journal, which mentioned that Munger had liked the company and had\\nspoken to Buffett about it. Warren then sent his top lieutenant at the time, David\\nSokol, to China. Shortly after that, Berkshire made an investment, and Sokol\\njoined BYD’s board.\\nAs investors, we began to make probabilistic assessments about all of this\\npublic information. For example, we knew that Li Lu, who is Chinese-American,\\nmanaged money for Munger. We had also read Munger’s public comment that\\nBYD’s CEO, Wang Chuan-Fu, “is a combination of Thomas Edison and Jack\\nWelch—something like Edison in solving technical problems, and something\\nlike Welch in getting done what he needs to do. I have never seen anything like\\nit.”\\nIn isolation, individual pieces of information like these don’t count for that\\nmuch. But they helped us to build a broader picture of what was going on and to\\nupdate our knowledge of the company, prompting us to ask what Munger, Li Lu,\\nBuffett, and Sokol might have seen in BYD that other investors had overlooked.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='I remember talking with Mohnish at the time and expressing my skepticism\\nabout the stock, given that this Chinese company lay outside my circle of\\ncompetence. In the end, it took me more than a year to get comfortable enough\\nto invest with real confidence that I understood the business. Mohnish, a more\\nadept bridge player and a less risk-averse investor, was able to buy earlier than\\nme because he was comfortable with the inferences he could draw from partial\\ninformation. As he put it to me, it counted for a lot to know that Buffett, Munger,\\nSokol, and Li Lu all considered the stock a winner. Mohnish’s willingness to act\\non incomplete information enabled him to buy BYD at a much lower price than I\\npaid once the information was more complete.\\nWith my bridge hat on, I’m always searching for the underlying truth, based\\non insufficient information. The game has helped me to recognize that it’s\\nsimply not possible to have a complete understanding of anything. We’re never\\ntruly going to get to the bottom of what’s going on inside a company, so we have\\nto make probabilistic inferences.\\nThis way of thinking proved particularly helpful after the credit crisis when\\nalmost everybody detested American money-center banks such as Citigroup,\\nBank of America, and JPMorgan Chase. I studied them carefully, asking myself\\nbridge-like questions such as: “How on earth can I claim to understand the\\nnuances of JPMorgan’s $2 trillion balance sheet?” The answer: I couldn’t. More\\nimportant, neither could JPMorgan’s own management—at least, not with great\\naccuracy. But I could make useful probabilistic inferences about the bank’s\\nbalance sheets and earning power. I asked myself, “Going forward, are these\\nlikely to be better or worse than other investors expect?”\\nMeanwhile, I read in the news that Buffett had just made a $5 billion\\ninvestment in the preferred stock of Bank of America. Based on probabilistic\\nthinking, this suggested to me that he believed the Fed was committed to\\nensuring that money-center banks would be able to rebuild their balance sheets.\\nBuffett’s investment helped me to understand that the Fed was highly unlikely to', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='raise interest rates until the banks were once again hugely profitable and healthy.\\nFor me, his weighing of these odds was revelatory. As Mohnish had pointed out,\\nBuffett’s involvement with banking stocks went back as far as 1969, and he’d\\nalmost never lost money on a bank bet. Given that nobody is a better investor in\\nbanks, Buffett’s seal of approval meant a lot.\\nFor good measure, at least half of Bank of America’s rivals had fallen by the\\nwayside, leaving the company in an even stronger position. Smaller banks would\\nstruggle to compete, given the mounting cost of technology in the banking\\nsector. And the legal risks facing the bank seemed lower than most people\\nrealized: after all, the litigation over the Exxon Valdez oil spill is still going on\\nafter 25 years. So it seemed likely to us that the banking sector could drag out\\nany lawsuits for many years, providing ample time to cover the potential cost of\\nany claims.\\nI ended up investing heavily in an array of money-center banks whose stocks\\nsubsequently rebounded, much as Warren, Mohnish, and I had expected. My\\nfamiliarity with bridge had helped me to become more adept at operating amid\\nthis kind of uncertainty. The key, perhaps, is that many investments are acutely\\nuncertain, but not as risky as they might at first seem. People often assume that\\ninvestors like me are great risk takers, perhaps little more than gamblers.\\nCertainly, there are plenty of reckless investors with scant regard for the risk of\\nloss, but they tend not to survive very long in the investing game. The long-term\\nsurvivors possess a more sophisticated grasp of risk, including the ability to see\\nwhen the situation is much less risky than the stock price might suggest. With\\nJPMorgan Chase and the other money-center banks there was a lot of\\nuncertainty, but very little risk.\\nBridge wasn’t the only game that captured my imagination or refined my\\nmental habits. I also rediscovered the joys of chess, a wonderful game of\\nanalysis and pattern recognition. I first fell in love with chess at Harvard, thanks\\nto my classmate Mark Pincus, who later founded Zynga, a social gaming', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='company that made him a billionaire. Back in our student days, Mark noticed an\\nunused chess set in my dorm and asked me to play. He thrashed me. I bought a\\nstack of chess books and we continued to play. I gradually got better and started\\nto win some games.\\nAfter graduating, I became a member of the Manhattan Chess Club and played\\npickup games in the park to escape from the horrors of my job at D. H. Blair. But\\nmy errant mind isn’t quiet enough, so I’ve never become more than a half-decent\\nplayer.\\nBack then, I had no sense of why chess was useful, not just enjoyable. But\\nover the years, I’ve come to see that there are real tactical benefits to\\nunderstanding how such games work. For example, in chess, there’s a set\\nrepertoire of opening tricks and mistakes that lead unsuspecting players to a\\nquick demise, usually within the first few moves. Initially, when I fell into these\\ntraps, I felt angry with my opponent. It seemed like an underhanded way to win.\\nThen I’d become angry with myself for missing what’s known as a “gotcha\\ngame.” As I studied chess more, I became less prone to these basic mistakes.\\nThere are useful parallels in the game of investing. For example, accounting is\\nfull of gotcha gambits. Corporations often manipulate accounting rules to\\npresent their numbers in deceptive ways—and the unsuspecting investor is easily\\nduped into thinking that the situation is less dangerous than it really is.\\nIn the late ’90s, I analyzed a company that sold legal insurance. Like life\\ninsurance, this product was sold by brokers who received hefty commissions in\\nreturn. The key to analyzing how profitable the firm really was lay in figuring\\nout the correct rate at which to amortize the cost of acquiring its customers. This,\\nin turn, was determined by how long those customers remained as clients after\\nsigning up. In my opinion, the company’s accounts presented an overly sunny\\nview of this, thus giving a misleading picture of the future. This struck me as the\\naccounting equivalent of a gotcha game of chess. So I steered clear of the stock,\\nwhich subsequently tumbled, triggering lawsuits and much hand-wringing', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='among everyone except the short-sellers, who had bet against the company on\\nthe basis of this dubious accounting.\\nThere was another way in which I found chess instructive. Early on, I had\\noften found myself playing games against so-called duffers—a derisive term for\\nplayers who make snap decisions based on emotions rather than on careful\\nanalysis. They either couldn’t or wouldn’t analyze the board in a considered\\nmanner. Initially, I often lost to the duffers. Their moves were so unpredictable\\nthat it would unnerve me and I’d lose my cool. But as I got better at the game, I\\nbecame more disciplined, developing the mental fortitude to remain calm and\\ncareful even while my opponent played with wild abandon.\\nIn the financial markets, plenty of investors—both amateur and professional—\\ntake foolhardy swings for the fences, betting on everything from hot tech stocks\\nto overhyped IPOs. Sometimes these risky long shots pay off spectacularly,\\ntempting other investors to follow their lead in making these duffer moves. But,\\nas in chess, I’ve found that it ultimately works better to maintain my discipline\\nand pursue a careful strategy with better odds of long-term success. In 2009,\\nwhen many investors bailed out of stocks, they were once again making a classic\\nduffer move. My opponent in that particular game wasn’t an idiotic chess player\\nbut the madness of Mr. Market. I knew that I simply had to keep my cool and\\nuse this madness to my advantage by buying stocks that the duffers were selling.\\nI was also struck by the memorable mantra of a chess champion, Edward\\nLasker, who remarked, “When you see a good move, look for a better one.”\\nApplying this insight to stocks, I modified his mantra, often telling myself,\\n“When you see a good investment, look for a better investment.” Indeed, as\\nMunger has pointed out, there’s a common tendency to like a particular idea—\\nwhether it’s a chess move or an investment—because it was the first one that\\npopped into our heads. But is it really superior? Chess highlights the need to\\nkeep searching for a better move even after the brain has latched onto that first\\nidea. Playing chess also strengthens this particular mental muscle.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='At the same time, I drew another fundamental lesson from my amateur\\nadventures in the world of bridge and chess. Yes, it’s true that these games taught\\nme helpful tactical lessons and mental habits while reinforcing my understanding\\nof how critical it is to control my emotions. But these games also taught me a\\nsimpler truth: after so many years of taking life too seriously, I needed to adopt a\\nmore playful attitude. So instead of seeing everything—including my work—as\\na form of mortal combat, I began to approach it in a different spirit, as if it were\\na game.\\nI have no doubt that Mark Pincus had acted like this all along. As a lover of all\\nsorts of games, he innately saw life as a game, and his playful attitude is an\\nintegral reason for his success. After Harvard, many of our classmates rushed to\\ntake dull positions at gold-standard investment banks and consulting firms.\\nThere was a common but shortsighted feeling that the first job out of school was\\na life-or-death decision. In reality, these first jobs are often all but irrelevant,\\ngiven the direction that our careers later take.\\nWhile many of our classmates had sewn up their plum jobs as much as a year\\nbefore graduating, Mark had no clear sense of what he’d do on leaving Harvard.\\nHe looked instead for companies that simply caught his interest, where he could\\nkeep playing the game of life. As a result, he went to work for John Malone at\\nTCI in a suburb of Denver, learning lessons about the communications industry\\nthat later proved invaluable. The moment a more compelling opportunity arose,\\nhe left to found his first company. When I visited him in San Francisco in those\\nearly days, he told me, “It’s not about how much money you make. It’s about\\nchanging the world.”\\nSteve Jobs took a similarly adventurous and playful approach to life. As he\\nwhimsically put it in his commencement speech at Stanford, “Stay foolish.”\\nLikewise, Buffett treats the investment business as a game and does little that\\ncompromises his day-to-day happiness.\\nAfter surviving the financial crisis, I became more conscious of the benefits of', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='this lighter, more playful approach. Following Warren’s lead, I stopped forcing\\nmyself to do things that I didn’t want to do. To this day, I work hard, but I work\\nmy own hours; if I want to take a nap during the day, I take a nap. In 2009, my\\nfund had a fantastic year, thanks in large part to the stocks I’d bought during the\\ncrash. One business associate told me that I should go out and market myself,\\npounding the table to get more people to invest with me. I told him, “I don’t\\nwant to. I want to have a happy life. I don’t need to have the biggest fund.”\\nThis attitude has undoubtedly made for a calmer and more joyful life. But I\\nsuspect it’s also made me a better investor. To give you an analogy, when you\\ndrop a stone in a calm pond, you see the ripples. Likewise, in investing, if I want\\nto see the big ideas, I need a peaceful and contented mind. This reminds me of a\\nline that Mohnish often quotes from Blaise Pascal: “All of humanity’s problems\\nstem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.” Among the many gifts\\nof my life in Zurich, none has been more important than my sense of quiet\\ncontentment. When I’m in this state, the right investment ideas have a way of\\nbursting through to me. Surprisingly often, these ideas seize me while I’m on a\\nbike ride or enjoying my life in some other way that’s unconnected to the\\nmarkets.\\nThat said, some of my professional investor friends are bemused when they\\nsee me heading off on trips to India and the like. One of them chided me, “Guy,\\nthese things won’t contribute to your returns.” I had to explain that I was no\\nlonger trying to be the greatest investor at all costs. My goal is no longer to be\\nWarren Buffett, even if I could be. My real mission is to be a more authentic\\nversion of myself.\\nAt a recent annual meeting for my fund, someone in the audience asked me\\nhow I handle the process of selling stocks. I replied, “Badly.” To some extent, I\\nwas being facetious. But I was also being light-heartedly honest because I don’t\\nbelieve that anyone handles the selling process particularly well. We can all\\nclaim to have clear rules—for example, declaring that a stock must be sold when', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='it reaches 80 percent of its intrinsic value. But the truth is that this is an\\nincredibly inexact science. There are stocks in my portfolio that, on a purely\\nrational basis, I should probably sell. But I often hold onto them anyway. One\\nreason is that I’m trying to manage myself, not just my portfolio. And I believe\\nthat my investment returns will be better over several decades if I master the\\ntrigger-happy side of my nature.\\nMore to the point, in confessing publicly that I’m not particularly good at\\nselling, I was no longer trying to dazzle anybody with my brilliance or convince\\npeople to invest in my fund. I was more focused on giving an honest account of\\nmyself than on selling. If people want to invest alongside me and my family, I’m\\ndelighted. If not, I no longer feel the stab of rejection that I felt in the past. After\\nall, this is not life and death. It’s not mortal combat.\\nBut if I’m honest about it, there’s still a deep-seated part of me that can never\\nquite let go of the idea that money is a matter of survival. This is simply part of\\nmy wiring. Intellectually, I see the abundant benefits of viewing the stock market\\nas a game—and I’ve no doubt improved as an investor by taking this more\\nplayful approach. But I also know that my shareholders’ life savings are on the\\nline. So investing may be a game, but for me, it’s a deadly serious game.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='10\\nINVESTING TOOLS\\nBuilding a Better Process\\nIf ants can use a handful of simple rules to develop an infinitely complex\\nsurvival strategy, what about investors? Can we create a similarly robust set of\\nrules that will make our investment decisions smarter and less vulnerable to the\\ndistortions of our irrational brains?\\nHere’s one way to think about this: the human brain is said to run on about 12\\nwatts—in other words, only a fifth of the power that’s needed by a 60-watt light\\nbulb. That’s not much at all, given the power consumption of some of the\\ncomputers that exist today. Yet we expect this relatively puny hardware to make\\nimmensely complex calculations about the investing world, and we even have\\nthe audacity to hope that we might get these calculations right.\\nAs we’ve discussed, one way to tilt the playing field to our advantage is to\\nconstruct an environment in which we can operate more rationally—or at least\\nless irrationally. But there’s also another tool at our disposal: if we’re looking to\\nmake better investment decisions, it helps immeasurably to develop a series of\\nrules and routines that we can apply consistently.\\nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis, I worked hard to establish for myself\\nthis more structured approach to investing, thereby bringing more order and\\npredictability to my behavior while also reducing the complexity of my decision-\\nmaking process. Simplifying everything makes sense, given the brain’s limited\\nprocessing power. The rules that I developed encompass a wide-ranging\\nassortment of critical investment processes, including what I read (and in what', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='order) when I’m researching stocks; whom I speak with (and refuse to speak\\nwith) about potential investments; how I deal with corporate management; how I\\ntrade stocks; and how I communicate (and don’t) with my shareholders.\\nSome of these rules are broadly applicable; others are more idiosyncratic and\\nmay work better for me than for you. What’s more, this remains a work in\\nprogress—a game plan that I keep revising as I learn from experience what\\nworks best. Still, I’m convinced that it will help you enormously if you start\\nthinking about your own investment processes in this structured, systematic way.\\nPilots internalize an explicit set of rules and procedures that guide their every\\naction and ensure the safety of themselves and their passengers. Investors who\\nare serious about achieving good returns without undue risk should follow their\\nexample. Why? Because in investing, as in flying, human error can be a bitch.\\nLike so many things in my investing life, my understanding of this issue grew\\nout of conversations with Mohnish. During our trip to India in 2009, I quizzed\\nhim about all manner of things, including his approach to trading stocks. It was\\nclear that he’d thought through these questions in a relentlessly logical way and\\nconstructed rules that governed everything he did. For example, as we’ll discuss,\\nhe had decided that he’d never put in an order to buy or sell a stock during the\\nhours when the market is open.\\nWhen I returned from that trip, I said to myself, “Guy, you’re doing this all\\nwrong.” Mohnish is wired differently from me in many ways, including a\\nreadiness to assume more apparent risk—or uncertainty—than I’m willing or\\nable to deal with emotionally. But I was determined to follow his lead in\\nbringing this analytical rigor to my own process. Here, then, are eight of the\\nrules, routines, and habits that I’ve subsequently put in place. This isn’t an\\nexhaustive list by any means. But I hope it gives you a flavor of what I’ve\\nlearned so far.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='1. Stop Checking the Stock Price\\nWhen I settled in Zurich, I made a conscious decision to keep renting a\\nBloomberg terminal but not to switch it on when I got to work each morning. As\\nI’ve mentioned, I now keep the Bloomberg switched off for weeks on end. But\\nthis is just one aspect of my effort to detach myself from the daily noise of the\\nmarketplace.\\nMany investors check their stock prices not only on a daily basis but also\\nsometimes minute-by-minute. There’s a peculiar glitch in our brains that\\nsomehow makes us think that the stock knows we’re watching it. We may even\\nhave a nagging fear that if we stop paying constant attention, something bad will\\nhappen. Maybe a big news story will sideswipe us while we’re not watching and\\nthe stock will suddenly blow up. Seeing the stock price on the monitor gives the\\ninvestor a false measure of reassurance that everything is okay, that the earth is\\nstill revolving in its usual orbit.\\nThe problem is, the constant movement of the stock price is a call to action. If\\nI see a brightly lit ticker symbol flashing on my Bloomberg screen, it tells my\\nirrational brain that I need to do something. If you’re speculating on the latest\\nhot biotech or Internet stock, it may make some sense to follow every mad\\ngyration: a brokerage firm issues a wildly bullish report and your stock suddenly\\nsurges by 20 percent as other speculators pile in. But I’m trying to invest in a\\nmore measured way, buying stakes in companies that I’m looking to hold for\\nyears, if not indefinitely. As Buffett has said, when we invest in a business, we\\nshould be willing to own it even if the stock market were to close the next day\\nand not reopen for five years.\\nI can’t switch off my monitor for five years because I need to approve the net\\nasset value of my fund once a month so that I can send a monthly update to my\\nshareholders on the value of their stake in our partnership. But if I were', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='managing solely my own account, I’d set up a system in which I’d look at the\\nprice of my holdings only once a quarter, or possibly even once a year. As things\\nstand, I check the price of my holdings no more than once a week. It’s a\\nwonderful release to see that your portfolio does just fine when you don’t check\\nit. For good measure, I don’t have my computer or Bloomberg monitor set up to\\nshow me the price of all my holdings on one screen; if I need to check the price\\nof a stock, I do it individually so that I won’t see the price of all my other stocks\\nat the same time. I don’t want to see these other prices unnecessarily and to\\nsubject myself to this barrage of calls to action.\\nIt’s worth thinking a little more about the effect of all this gratuitous noise on\\nmy poor brain. Checking the stock price too frequently uses up my limited\\nwillpower since it requires me to expend unnecessary mental energy simply\\nresisting these calls to action. Given that my mental energy is a scarce resource, I\\nwant to direct it in more constructive ways.\\nWe also know from behavioral finance research by Daniel Kahneman and\\nAmos Tversky that investors feel the pain of loss twice as acutely as the pleasure\\nof gain. So I need to protect my brain from the emotional storm that occurs when\\nI see that my stocks—or the market—are down. If there’s average volatility, the\\nmarket is typically up in most years over a 20-year period. But if I check it\\nfrequently, there’s a much higher probability that it will be down at that\\nparticular moment. (Nassim Taleb explains this in detail in his superb book\\nFooled by Randomness.) Why, then, put myself in a position where I may have a\\nnegative emotional reaction to this short-term drop, which sends all the wrong\\nsignals to my brain?\\nIn any case, with the type of businesses I invest in, it’s not imperative to know\\nwhat’s going on from day to day. Virtually all my investments are in companies\\nwhere the long-term outcome is all but inexorable: the company is heading in\\nthat positive direction, and it’s really just a question of how long it takes.\\nBuffett’s holdings clearly possess this same precious characteristic. Indeed, he', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='uses the word “inevitable” to describe the positive outcome that he ultimately\\nexpects. Consider his stake in Burlington Northern Santa Fe. There’s no question\\nthat its transportation network will become more valuable as the US economy\\ngrows, the country becomes more built up, and the railway industry consolidates.\\nPlus, nobody will build a rival railway track next door, so Burlington won’t be\\ndisplaced.\\nIf you invest in businesses like this that are truly inexorable, it shouldn’t really\\nmatter if you switch off the monitor, curl up on the sofa, and read a book. After\\nall, Buffett didn’t make billions off companies like American Express and Coca-\\nCola by focusing on the meaningless daily movements of the stock ticker.\\nThe Rule: Check stock prices as infrequently as possible.\\n2. If Someone Tries to Sell You Something, Don’t Buy It\\nIn the early years of my New York vortex period, my fund’s returns were decent,\\nand I was hurt that nobody seemed to be paying attention to me. Then I must\\nhave landed on various databases because the phone started ringing off the hook.\\nEverybody wanted to sell me something. Brokers rang to pitch me stocks. Sales\\nreps called to sell me high-priced research systems, investment newsletter\\nsubscriptions, new phone services, and countless other products. At first, these\\ncalls seemed a measure of my success, as if all this attention put me on the map.\\nBut I soon began to see that I made lousy decisions when I bought things that\\nsalespeople were hawking to me.\\nThe problem is that my brain (and most likely your brain too) is awful at\\nmaking rational decisions when confronted with a well-argued, detailed pitch\\nfrom a gifted salesperson. So I adopted a simple rule that has proved\\nextraordinarily beneficial. When people call to pitch me anything at all, I reply\\nin as pleasant a manner as possible, “I’m sorry. But I have a rule that I don’t\\nallow myself to buy anything that’s being sold to me.”', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Aghast, salespeople counter with questions like: “But how are you going to\\npick the right phone service?” Sell-side equity analysts opine: “But don’t you\\nthink this is a great stock?”\\nSometimes they’re no doubt right. Logically, perhaps, I should switch phone\\nservices or load up on their brilliant investment idea. But I just won’t do it. I may\\nmiss out in the short term. But over a lifetime I have no doubt that I’ll benefit\\nmuch more by detaching myself from people with a self-interest in getting me to\\nbuy stuff. This is a simple application of “adverse selection.” As Charlie Munger\\nhas joked, “All I want to know is where I’m going to die so I’ll never go there.”\\nFor me, if an investment is being sold, that’s a place where I certainly want to\\navoid going.\\nI even apply this rule if I’m at a cocktail party and someone starts telling me\\nabout a great stock they own or a private company in which they’d like me to\\ninvest. I may listen. I may be impressed. I may even be tempted. But I won’t buy\\nit if they would gain something from my doing so. In some cases, this might not\\nbe a sales commission or any other financial benefit: it might simply be that they\\nderive psychological validation from successfully selling their idea. Either way,\\nthis is a no-go zone for me because the provenance of the idea is wrong since it\\nstems from the seller’s personal agenda.\\nAs usual, Buffett knew this long before I did. For example, he has a rule never\\nto participate in an open outcry auction. Following his lead, I’ve never invested\\nin an IPO and probably never will. When a company is going public, it has all of\\nthe mind-warping sales power of Wall Street behind it. Of course, some IPOs\\ncatch the wind perfectly and soar. But the provenance is toxic, so it’s safer for\\nme to cross all IPOs off my buy list, even if this means missing out on an\\noccasional winner.\\nThe Rule: If the seller has a self-interest in me buying, I ain’t buying.\\n3. Don’t Talk to Management', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='For much the same reason, I don’t want to speak with the management of the\\ncompanies I’m researching. Many smart investors would disagree with me on\\nthis. For them, it’s possible that regular contact with senior executives may be\\nfruitful. Also, this promise of high-level access can be a useful marketing tool,\\nappealing to existing shareholders and prospective investors who may not\\nunderstand that talking to management has a potential downside.\\nHeretical as this might sound, my own experience is that close contact with\\nmanagement is more likely to be detrimental to my investment returns. The\\ntrouble is, senior managers—particularly CEOs—tend to be highly skilled\\nsalespeople. No matter how their business is performing, they have a gift for\\nmaking the listener feel optimistic about the company’s prospects. This ability to\\nwin over their audience, including board members and shareholders, may be the\\nmost important talent that got them to the top of the corporate food chain. But\\nthis gift of the gab doesn’t necessarily make them a dependable source of\\ninformation.\\nThis isn’t to say that CEOs, CFOs, and other top executives are malicious or\\nimmoral. Far be it from me to suggest anything so disrespectful! It’s just that\\ntheir job, their agenda, and their skills lead them to present information in a way\\nthat accentuates the positive while discounting any business problems by\\ndescribing them as either temporary or solvable. They may be skewing\\ninformation subconsciously, without any bad intent. But it doesn’t matter.\\nKnowing my own rational limitations, I’d prefer not to expose myself to this\\npotentially distorting influence. And it strikes me as especially dangerous for\\ninvestors to allow management to help form their first impressions of a company.\\nI know some money managers who will do their research, then say, “I need to\\nmeet management so I can get comfortable.” But who knows how management\\nwill mess with their minds? If I have to meet the CEO to understand why I\\nshould buy the stock, that’s a serious warning sign. It should be clear enough\\nfrom all of my other research. And if I want to assess the quality of the', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='management, I’d rather do it in a detached and impersonal way by studying the\\nannual reports and other public data, along with news stories. It’s better to\\nobserve them indirectly like this instead of venturing into their distortion field by\\nmeeting them one-on-one.\\nIn retrospect, I realize that it was observing Mohnish that convinced me to\\nstop speaking with management. When we first discussed this around 2008, it\\nwas a foreign concept to me since it flew in the face of conventional wisdom,\\neven among value investors. Now I wonder why it took me so long to\\nunderstand that this simple practice cuts out a whole lot of noise.\\nThe Rule: Beware of CEOs and other top management, no matter how\\ncharismatic, persuasive, and amiable they seem.\\nExceptions to the rule: Berkshire’s chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett, and\\na small but growing minority of CEOs (at companies like Fairfax Financial,\\nLeucadia National Corporation, and Markel Insurance) who take seriously the\\nidea of sharing what they would like to know if they were in their shareholders’\\nshoes.\\n4. Gather Investment Research in the Right\\nOrder\\nWe know from Munger’s speech on the causes of human misjudgment that the\\nfirst idea to enter the brain tends to be the one that sticks. As he explained, “the\\nhuman mind is a lot like the human egg, and the human egg has a shut-off\\ndevice. When one sperm gets in, it shuts down so the next one can’t get in. The\\nhuman mind has a big tendency of the same sort.” If that’s true, I need to be\\nextremely careful about the order in which I gather research and explore\\ninvestment ideas. I want to evaluate them from a position of strength, not\\nweakness. If the idea comes from a salesperson, it immediately puts me in a', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='weak position. So, as we’ve discussed, I simply eliminate ideas from\\nsalespeople: I don’t want to allow a sell-side analyst’s pitch (however well-\\nreasoned) to be the first idea that settles insidiously inside my brain.\\nBut what if a friend or peer I respect suggests that I look at a particular stock\\nthat they think I should buy? Even hearing about an idea verbally like this isn’t\\nideal because it’s difficult for any investor to be detached and rational when a\\nsmart person tells them why something is great. So I try to stop them short and\\nsay something like, “Wow, it sounds really interesting. Let me read up on it\\nbefore we talk so we can have an informed conversation about it.”\\nIf I have a business relationship with the person, I can tell them, “I’d love to\\nhear about your investment idea. Please could you send it to me in writing?” If\\nthey object and say, “Oh, but I really need to talk to you about it first,” I tell\\nthem that I just can’t do it. Socially, it might seem awkward to insist on getting\\nan idea in writing first. But it’s important to take as much heat and emotion as\\npossible out of the research process. In my experience, I’m much better at\\nfiltering what I read than what I hear.\\nOnce I decide that an investment idea is promising enough for me to explore it\\nfurther, I still need to be careful to do the research in the right sequence. This\\nmight not seem important to many investors, but the order in which I read the\\nmaterials matters greatly since whatever I take in first will affect me unduly.\\nMy routine is to start with the least biased and most objective sources. These\\nare typically the company’s public filings, including the annual report, 10K,\\n10Q, and proxy statement. These aren’t perfect, but they are prepared with a\\ngood deal of care and attention, especially in the United States, and they are\\nreviewed by lawyers. The company doesn’t want to get sued, so there’s an\\nincentive to produce financial statements that investors can rely upon. The\\naccountant’s audit letter is also key. Occasionally, accountants may be under\\nintense pressure to sign off on the accounts, overlooking any irregularities. But\\nthe auditor’s letter can subtly signal that the accounts are not all that they appear', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='to be. Reading financial statements is more of an art than a science. Even if it’s\\nnot explicit, you sometimes sense that management is trying to provide less\\ninformation than investors might find useful. As in poker, unconscious “tells”\\ncan appear even in a footnote, making you wonder if something is amiss.\\nIn the annual report, the management’s introductory letter is also important. Is\\nit a public relations puff piece, or is there a genuine desire to communicate\\nwhat’s going on? I want to avoid promotional companies that are bent on\\nshowing things in the best possible light. By contrast, when Berkshire released\\nthe offering document for its B-class shares, it candidly stated that Warren and\\nCharlie wouldn’t buy them at that price.\\nAfter working my way through the corporate filings, I typically turn to less\\nobjective corporate documents—things like earnings announcements, press\\nreleases, and transcripts of conference calls. There might also be helpful\\ninformation to glean from a book about the company or its founder. These are\\nfairly useful if they’re not just vanity pieces since many hours of work have gone\\ninto them; in some cases, they have such depth that I’d read them before the\\ncorporate filings. Investors looking at Berkshire for the first time would do well\\nto read the books that Roger Lowenstein and Alice Schroeder wrote about\\nBuffett. Likewise, in studying Wal-Mart, a good place to start would be Sam\\nWalton’s book Made in America.\\nThese ideas about the sequencing of information may seem trite. But minor\\nshifts in how we operate can have a major impact. By consistently improving the\\nway I consume information, I’m looking to create better conditions for success\\nover many years. Still, we’re all wired differently, so my idea of a healthy and\\nbalanced informational diet may be different from yours. The Wall Street Journal\\nonce noted that Buffett had a small TV in his office, tuned to CNBC, but with\\nthe volume muted. I’d find it terribly distracting to have a TV at work as it\\nwould stimulate my brain in unhelpful ways.\\nI also try (and sometimes fail) to minimize my exposure to the Internet, which', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='can lead me in a thousand different directions. It requires a lot of mental energy\\nto read a web page, with all its links to other information. I don’t want my\\nmind’s chain to be yanked. So I prefer to read the physical editions of things like\\nthe Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, the Economist, Barron’s, Fortune,\\nBloomberg Businessweek, and Forbes, along with more abstruse publications\\nlike American Banker and the International Railway Journal.\\nStill, I avoid reading any press coverage until after I’ve studied the corporate\\nfilings. There are plenty of good journalists who provide useful context and\\ninsight. But for my purposes, it’s important not to prioritize news stories, since\\nthey give my brain reasons to act, often without providing real substance. The\\ncorporate filings are my meat and vegetables—less enjoyable, but usually more\\nnutritious.\\nAs for the equity research published by brokerage firms, I read little of it, and\\nI never rely on it. Once I’m finished with all of my other research, I sometimes\\npull up these reports so that I know what Wall Street is saying about a company\\nor industry. But I’m careful to make this research the last thing I read, so that\\nI’ve already formed my own impression. I don’t deny that there are smart people\\nworking on the sell side. In some cases, they provide remarkable insight,\\nparticularly about industry dynamics. So it would be unwise and unfair to\\ndismiss an entire community. But their work is paid for by brokerage dollars.\\nWhen I read it, I’m exposing myself to Wall Street, which is one big selling\\nmachine. Also, my goal in creating all of these habits is to get out of sync with\\nthe markets; moving in lockstep with them is a recipe for average results.\\nThe Rule: Pay attention to the order in which you consume information. And\\ndon’t eat your dessert until you’ve finished your meat and vegetables.\\n5. Discuss Your Investment Ideas Only with People Who Have No Axe to Grind\\nBy now I probably sound like some weird mix of social outcast and appalling', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='snob—refusing to speak with CEOs, sell-side analysts, or anyone else from the\\nworld of sales. Many of them are no doubt charming, upstanding citizens with\\nmortgages to pay and angelic children to support. But, in my eyes, their\\nunderlying sales agenda is a fatal flaw. So is there anyone that I am actually\\nhappy to speak with about potential investments? Good question. Thanks for\\nasking.\\nIf I want somebody else’s perspective (and I often do), I find it more useful to\\nseek out the opinion of a trusted peer on the buy side. Over the years, I’ve had\\ninvaluable discussions with investors like Nick Sleep, Chris Hohn, Bill Ackman,\\nSteven Wallman, Allen Benello, Ken Shubin Stein, Dante Albertini, Jonathan\\nBrandt, and Greg Alexander. All of them have taught me a great deal without\\ntrying to teach me anything. In my experience, the best people to speak with\\nabout investments aren’t just intelligent but have an ability to keep their ego out\\nof the conversation. As a result, these discussions tend to be playful and fun, and\\nthey don’t disturb my calm pond. Increasingly, the person I speak with most\\nabout potential investments is Mohnish, partly because his analytical gifts are off\\nthe charts, but also because he doesn’t have any axe to grind.\\nI’ve found that investment discussions work best when they adhere to three\\nground rules that I borrowed from groups like the Young Presidents’\\nOrganization. First, the conversation must be strictly confidential. Second,\\nneither person can tell the other what to do as this tends to make people feel\\njudged, so they become defensive. In fact, it helps if you don’t even know\\nwhether the other person is thinking of buying or selling the stock since that\\nknowledge muddies the waters. Third, we can’t have any business relationship\\nbecause this could skew the conversation by adding a subtle or not-so-subtle\\nfinancial agenda. Of course, what matters most in these conversations is mutual\\ntrust. So no action should be taken unless the other person gives clear\\npermission. If I’m interested in buying the stock or discussing it with someone\\nelse, I need to ask specifically if that’s okay. If it’s not, I can’t do it.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='The goal of these conversations isn’t to reach the “right answer” or engage in\\nintelligent debate. It’s to share our experiences and information. To achieve this,\\nit helps to ask open-ended questions. For example, instead of asking what a\\ncompany will earn next year, it’s more useful to ask something like, “What needs\\nto happen for them to generate a lot of cash next year?”\\nI remember a specific conversation that I had with Shai Dardashti, a money\\nmanager friend who has given me permission to share what we discussed. At the\\ntime, he was researching K-Swiss, a manufacturer of athletic shoes. I had done a\\nlot of research into Nike and had looked at the impact of its sponsorship on\\ntennis and soccer. Instead of telling Shai that I thought K-Swiss was an also-ran\\nin the sneaker business, I suggested that he produce a list of the top 20 tennis\\nplayers, see who sponsored them, then estimate which of those players attracted\\nthe most viewers in what is typically a winner-take-all market. In the process, he\\ndiscovered that K-Swiss had only one player on the list, while Nike had six or\\nseven—an indication that K-Swiss faced an all but insuperable challenge to win\\nmarket share away from Nike. At no point did we discuss whether Shai already\\nowned the stock or was thinking of buying it. But I’m guessing that our\\ndiscussion helped to clarify that it wasn’t the best place for him to invest.\\nThe Rule: Pool your knowledge with other investors, but stick with people\\nwho can keep their ego in check. If the other person happens to be Buffett,\\nMunger, or Pabrai, so much the better.\\n6. Never Buy or Sell Stocks When the Market Is Open\\nWall Street is perfectly designed to take advantage of weaknesses in the human\\nbrain. For example, unscrupulous brokerages create well-honed scripts that\\nenable their brokers to call their marks—I mean clients—to convince them to\\nbuy particular stocks. The underlying goal is to generate lucrative trading\\nactivity for the firm itself. As a long-term value investor, my interests are in stark', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='opposition to the interests of Wall Street. What I need to do is simply invest in a\\nhandful of great but undervalued businesses and then stay put. Wall Street is\\nrewarded for activity. My shareholders and I are rewarded for inactivity.\\nTo help myself function this way, I need a series of circuit breakers that slow\\nme down and prevent me from acting precipitously. Some of these routines and\\nprocedures are so obvious that it might seem as if they are not even worth\\nmentioning. But I’ve found them immensely beneficial, and it doesn’t take a lot\\nof energy or thought to implement them.\\nWhen it comes to buying and selling stocks, I need to detach myself from the\\nprice action of the market, which can stir up my emotions, stimulate my desire to\\nact, and cloud my judgment. So I have a rule, inspired by Mohnish, that I don’t\\ntrade stocks while the market is open. Instead, I prefer to wait until trading hours\\nhave ended. I then email one of my two brokers—preferring not to speak with\\nthem directly—and ask to trade the stock at the average price for the upcoming\\nday. I’m not trying to get an edge on the market because I don’t want to get\\nswept up in its constant mood swings. As Ben Graham explained, we have to try\\nto make the market our servant, not our master.\\nOccasionally I break this rule because there’s a particularly compelling reason\\nto trade a stock during market hours. As with all of these rules, the point is not to\\nlet them become a straitjacket but to have them guide my behavior in a generally\\nhealthier direction. In the case of this trading rule, what matters is that I’m\\ngiving myself permission to disengage from the market.\\nBy contrast, in my early years as a fund manager, I had an in-house trading\\ndesk. This was a terrible idea because it brought the market into the heart of my\\noffice in a way that was even worse than having a Bloomberg terminal. I also\\nused to talk directly to traders, who would ask me questions like, “Do you want\\nme to take a look on the floor and get some color on the market?” I didn’t know\\nany better so I let myself be exposed to this head-spinning barrage of market\\naction. All this information made me feel powerful and gave me an illusion of', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='control.\\nMy view now is that we’re simply not wired to deal with this constant flood of\\nprice information. But it took years for me to learn this and also to develop the\\ndiscipline to say, “I’m just going to ignore all this noise.” At first, this can be\\nquite scary. But in my experience, it’s marvelously liberating.\\nThe Rule: Keep the market at a safe distance. Don’t let it invade your office or\\nyour brain.\\n7. If a Stock Tumbles after You Buy It,\\nDon’t Sell It for Two Years\\nWhen a stock has surged, selling it can be a joy. But it can also be bittersweet,\\nlike parting with an old friend. When a stock has tumbled, selling it is even more\\nemotionally fraught. After all, it’s hard to make rational decisions about an\\ninvestment that has already lost you a lot of money since negative emotions such\\nas remorse, self-loathing, and fear can short-circuit the ability to think clearly.\\nMohnish developed a rule to deal with the psychological forces aroused in these\\nsituations: if he buys a stock and it goes down, he won’t allow himself to sell it\\nfor two years.\\nHe explained this to me around the time of our lunch with Warren Buffett, and\\nit made so much sense that I instantly adopted this rule. Once again, it acts as a\\ncircuit breaker, a way to slow me down and improve my odds of making rational\\ndecisions. Even more important, it forces me to be more careful before buying a\\nstock since I know that I’ll have to live with my mistakes for at least two years.\\nThat knowledge helps me to avoid a lot of bad investments. In fact, before\\nbuying a stock, I consciously assume that the price will immediately fall by 50\\npercent, and I ask myself if I’ll be able to live through it. I then buy only the\\namount that I could handle emotionally if this were to happen.\\nMohnish’s rule is a variation on an important idea that Warren has often shared', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='with students. As Warren once put it, “I could improve your ultimate financial\\nwelfare by giving you a ticket with only 20 slots in it, so that you had 20\\npunches—representing investments that you got to make in a lifetime. And once\\nyou’d punched through the card, you couldn’t make any more investments at all.\\nUnder those rules, you’d really think carefully about what you did, and you’d be\\nforced to load up on what you’d really thought about. So you’d do much better.”\\nThe Rule: Before buying any stock, make sure you like it enough to hold on\\nfor at least two years, even if the price halves right after you buy it.\\n8. Don’t Talk about Your Current Investments\\nOver the years, I began to realize that it was a bad idea to speak publicly about\\nstocks that I own. The issue isn’t that other investors might steal my best ideas.\\nThe real problem is that it messes with my head. Once we’ve made a public\\nstatement, it’s psychologically difficult to back away from what we’ve said—\\neven if we’ve come to regret that opinion. So the last thing I want to do is walk\\ninto the trap of making a public statement about a stock, given that the situation\\nmight later change or that I might subsequently discover that I was wrong.\\nI first encountered this idea in Munger’s talk on the causes of human\\nmisjudgment, which led me to Robert Cialdini’s book Influence: Science and\\nPractice. Cialdini described this peculiar feature of our mental wiring as the\\n“commitment and consistency principle.” To demonstrate this idea, he wrote\\nabout a 1966 psychology experiment in which residents of Palo Alto were asked\\nif they’d do something that wouldn’t cost much money but would help their\\nneighborhood. A few days later, they were asked to put an ugly sign on their\\nfront lawns to stop drivers speeding through the neighborhood. Residents who\\nhad previously committed to doing something inexpensive to help their\\nneighborhood found it extraordinarily hard to change their stated position so\\nthey typically felt obliged to install these signs on their lawns.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Likewise, if you tell a child that you’re going to give them a treat, they’re\\nliable to reply, “You promise?” They intuitively understand that you’ll find it\\nhard to reverse course after taking a position.\\nI experienced this firsthand with a stock called EVCI, which I bought around\\n2003. Within 18 months, it surged seven-fold, making it the most successful\\ninvestment I had made up to that point. As we’ll discuss later, I should have sold\\nall of my shares. But I had given an interview to Value Investor Insight, extolling\\nEVCI as an example of my investing prowess. As a result, I was publicly\\ninvested in the stock and couldn’t part with it even though it was no longer\\ncheap. For various reasons, the stock subsequently halved. In retrospect, I could\\nsee that I would have been much better off if I’d never spoken about it since this\\nwould have given me more latitude to sell once the circumstances changed.\\nStill, it took me a long time to act on this knowledge and actually stop\\nspeaking publicly about my holdings. Sometimes it was necessary to disclose\\nwhat I was doing. For example, after my fund was battered in the financial crisis,\\nI needed to reassure my shareholders so that they wouldn’t lose heart. I talked to\\nthem at length about current holdings such as Cresud and London Mining,\\nmaking it clear that these were remarkably cheap stocks with great prospects.\\nIn 2010, after my fund had rebounded sharply, I finally made the change: I\\nstopped discussing my current investments in public settings, including my\\nannual meetings, interviews with journalists, and letters to shareholders. At first,\\nthis wasn’t an easy shift to make. Once you create an expectation in the\\nmarketplace, it’s difficult to reverse yourself without people feeling that they’re\\nbeing shortchanged. But this change in procedure was well worth the risk of\\nleaving a few noses bent out of shape.\\nI’m not dogmatic about this rule. If I’m chatting privately with a shareholder, I\\nmight end up talking about a particular stock that we own. But even in these\\nprivate conversations, I try to remain neutral and understated, resisting the\\ntemptation to talk heatedly about why I think a stock is great. I know how hard it', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='can subsequently be to make a decision that’s inconsistent with these statements.\\nSo why create this potential headache when it’s so easily avoidable?\\nInstead of discussing current holdings in my letters to shareholders, I now\\nprovide a detailed postmortem on stocks that I’ve already sold. This gives\\nshareholders a clear insight into how their money is being invested, but it doesn’t\\ninterfere with my ability to act as rationally as possible going forward. For me,\\nthis has certainly removed a psychological burden. I’d argue that most individual\\ninvestors would also benefit from keeping quiet about their current investments\\nsince this talk only makes it harder to operate in a rational way. It’s so much\\neasier when you don’t have to worry about how other people might judge you.\\nThe Rule: Don’t say anything publicly about your investments that you may\\nlive to regret.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='11\\nAN INVESTOR’S CHECKLIST', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Survival Strategies from a Surgeon\\nEven with a well-constructed environment and a robust set of investment rules,\\nwe’re still going to mess up. The brain is simply not designed to work with\\nmeticulous logic through all of the possible outcomes of our investment\\ndecisions. The complexity of the business and economic world, combined with\\nour irrationality in the face of money-related issues, guarantees that we’ll make\\nplenty of dumb mistakes. The habits and processes that we’ve discussed so far\\nshould help us to edge in the right direction. But there is one other investment\\ntool that is so invaluable that it merits a chapter of its own: a checklist.\\nThe goal in creating a checklist is to avoid obvious and predictable errors.\\nBefore I make the final decision to buy any stock, I turn to my checklist in a last-\\nditch effort to prevent my unreliable brain from overlooking any potential\\nwarning signs that I might have missed. The checklist is the final circuit breaker\\nin my decision-making process.\\nThe idea for this didn’t originate with me, but with Atul Gawande. A former\\nRhodes Scholar at Oxford, he is now a surgeon at Brigham and Women’s\\nHospital in Boston, a professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School, and a\\nrenowned author. He’s a remarkable blend of practitioner and thinker, and also\\nan exceptionally nice guy.\\nIn December 2007, Gawande published a story in The New Yorker entitled\\n“The Checklist,” which drew heavily on his experience as a surgeon to explore a\\nproblem that is both profound and practical. As he put it, “intensive-care\\nmedicine has grown so far beyond ordinary complexity that avoiding daily\\nmistakes is proving impossible even for our super-specialists.” As he explained,\\nthis reflects a fundamental challenge that exists in other fields, too—namely,', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='“the art of managing extreme complexity,” and the question of “whether such\\ncomplexity can, in fact, be humanly mastered.”\\nHis article went on to describe the groundbreaking work of Peter Pronovost, a\\ncritical-care specialist at Johns Hopkins Hospital, who designed a checklist after\\na particular patient nearly died. Pronovost took a single sheet of paper and listed\\nall of the steps required to avoid the infection that had almost killed the man.\\nThese steps were all “no-brainers,” yet it turned out that doctors skipped at least\\none step with over a third of their patients. When the hospital began to use\\nchecklists, numerous deaths were prevented. This was partly because checklists\\nhelped with memory recall, “especially with mundane matters that are easily\\noverlooked,” and partly because they made explicit the importance of certain\\nprecautions. Other hospitals followed suit, adopting checklists as a pragmatic\\nway of coping with complexity.\\nWhen Mohnish read Gawande’s article, he had a eureka moment, instantly\\nrecognizing that the idea of a checklist could also be applied to investing—\\nanother field in which the complexity is so extreme that even super-specialists\\nroutinely trip up, making easily preventable mistakes. In our case, it isn’t fatal.\\nBut investing errors can be terribly costly to shareholders with their life savings\\non the line.\\nI was sitting in my office in Manhattan one afternoon when Mohnish emailed\\nme a copy of Gawande’s article. We then spoke on the phone, and it was clear\\nthat he was really excited. Mohnish has the kind of mind that easily makes\\nunusual connections, so it was immediately obvious to him that the checklist\\nidea was a big deal. I thought it was interesting, but it took me longer to\\nunderstand just how significant it might be. By now, I’m used to the fact that\\nMohnish is quicker on the uptake than I am. I console myself by contemplating a\\nsage observation of Buffett’s: “The key to life is figuring out who to be the\\nbatboy for.” As I realized long ago, there’s no dishonor in being Mohnish’s\\nbatboy. Far from it. And while I’m busy cloning Mohnish Pabrai, he’s busy', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='cloning Atul Gawande.\\nMohnish pursued the checklist idea with ferocious intensity and rigor. He\\nbegan by marshaling a group of us to recall a slew of investing mistakes we had\\nmade. In each case, we had to work out why they had happened and if there was\\na cause that we should have seen beforehand. Sometimes I would look back at a\\nsituation where I had missed some vital clue, shake my head, and say, “How did\\nI not see that?”\\nMohnish added his own mistakes to the mix. We combined these with some\\n(infrequent) errors that we had seen Buffett and Munger make, including their\\ninvestments in NetJets, Dexter Shoe Company, and Diversified Retailing—a\\nreminder that retail is a tougher place to make money than most people realize.\\nBuffett, with characteristic candor, confessed in his 2007 letter to shareholders:\\n“To date, Dexter is the worst deal I’ve made. But I’ll make more mistakes in the\\nfuture—you can bet on that. A line from Bobby Bare’s country song explains\\nwhat too often happens with acquisitions: ‘I’ve never gone to bed with an ugly\\nwoman, but I’ve sure woke up with a few.’”\\nMohnish and I also discussed Berkshire’s ill-timed investment in CORT\\nFurniture in 2000. CORT had made a fortune leasing furniture to start-up\\ncompanies during the heady years of the 1990s tech boom. But Buffett and\\nMunger had underestimated just how vulnerable its profits would be when this\\nbubble burst. Companies like eBay and Craigslist also ate into CORT’s sales by\\nmaking it cheap and easy to buy used furniture. Munger later described this\\ninvestment as a “macro-economic mistake.”\\nI helped Mohnish by carefully analyzing my own errors, along with those of\\nother investors. Mohnish himself worked at such a breakneck pace that it was\\nalmost unnerving. After we had compiled our initial list of mistakes—and the\\nlessons we should draw from them—he hired a couple of graduate students from\\nHarvard Business School to undertake a painstaking forensic investigation. They\\nstudied the 13F filings of about 20 smart value investors (including firms like', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Southeastern Asset Management and Fairholme Capital Management), counting\\nas a mistake any investment they had sold at a loss. The students then read\\nthrough the investors’ public statements and annual letters to reconstruct the\\nthinking behind these failed investments.\\nGawande himself became intrigued by what we were doing. He interviewed\\nMohnish and me, and he wrote a few pages about us in his 2009 bestseller The\\nChecklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right. Among other things, he\\nmentioned Mohnish’s realization that he had “repeatedly erred” in\\nunderestimating the riskiness of leveraged companies. As I suggested to\\nGawande, part of the problem might lie in what I described as “cocaine brain”:\\nthe intoxicating prospect of making money can arouse the same reward circuits\\nin the brain that are stimulated by drugs, making the rational mind ignore\\nsupposedly extraneous details that are actually very relevant. Needless to say,\\nthis mental state is not the best condition in which to conduct a cool and\\ndispassionate analysis of investment risk.\\nBy the time I settled in Zurich, we had assembled a veritable cornucopia of\\ncock-ups. These included several mistakes that Mohnish and I had made in the\\nrun-up to the credit crisis, when some of our stocks plunged by more than 80\\npercent. In our postmortem analysis, we were able to explore where we had gone\\nwrong—and, more important, design checklist items that would help to prevent\\nus from repeating these mistakes.\\nMohnish, who did the lion’s share of the work in this whole endeavor, ended\\nup grouping his checklist into about six broader categories, including themes\\nsuch as leverage and corporate management. It’s an incredible piece of\\nintellectual property. My own checklist, which borrows shamelessly from his,\\nincludes about 70 items, but it continues to evolve. Before pulling the trigger on\\nany investment, I pull out the checklist from my computer or the filing cabinet\\nnear my desk to see what I might be missing. Sometimes, this takes me as little\\nas 15 minutes, but it’s led me to abandon literally dozens of investments that I', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='might otherwise have made. In a typical case, I might conclude, “Okay, this\\nstock is failing on four of my checklist items.” On that basis, I’m unlikely to\\ninvest in it. But this isn’t a black-and-white mechanical process.\\nAs I’ve discovered from having ADD, the mind has a way of skipping over\\ncertain pieces of information—including rudimentary stuff like where I’ve left\\nmy keys. This also happens during the investment process. The checklist is\\ninvaluable because it redirects and challenges the investor’s wandering attention\\nin a systematic manner. I sometimes use my checklist in the middle of the\\ninvesting process to deepen my understanding of a company, but it’s most useful\\nright at the end as a way of backstopping myself.\\nThat said, it’s important to recognize that my checklist should not be your\\nchecklist. This isn’t something you can outsource since your checklist has to\\nreflect your own unique experience, knowledge, and previous mistakes. It’s\\ncritical to go through the arduous process of analyzing where things have gone\\nwrong for you in the past so you can see if there are any recurring patterns or\\nparticular areas of vulnerability. We’re all different, and we mess up in ways that\\nare often quite personal to us. For example, some investors are temperamentally\\ndrawn to the opportunities available in highly leveraged companies. I’m not, so I\\ndon’t need to have as many checklist items that warn me to tread carefully in this\\nkind of risky environment. By contrast, Mohnish is less fearful of heavily\\nindebted companies, so this is one area where he might need to be more\\ncautious.\\nSimilarly, an investor like Bill Ackman seems drawn to opportunities\\ninvolving controversial stocks where the management may be bamboozling\\ngullible investors. If I were Bill, I’d have a checklist item that said, “Am I being\\ndrawn into this situation not because it’s the best investment I can make, but\\nbecause I enjoy the thrill of the investigative chase and want to right the wrongs\\nof the world?” This is not a criticism of Bill, who is a superb investor and would\\nhave made an equally outstanding investigative journalist. It’s a matter of', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='looking at our idiosyncrasies and understanding where they tend to lead us.\\nIn my case, it’s particularly important for me to feel that people like me; I also\\nfind it hard to say “no” to people I like. This makes me vulnerable in certain\\nsituations as these emotional needs could short-circuit my rational judgment. To\\nhelp counter this, my checklist includes questions such as: “Is there some way in\\nwhich this investment idea is being sold to me? Does someone in this situation\\nhave an axe to grind? Who benefits if I make this investment? Does this\\ninvestment appeal to any personal biases of mine that should be reexamined?”\\nGiven my nature, it makes sense to explore this question of whether I might be\\ntrying to fulfill some other part of my personality instead of just maximizing my\\nreturns. A checklist is a way of managing your own mind and guarding against\\nyour own proclivities, so it needs to be based on this kind of self-awareness.\\nMy other caveat is that a checklist is emphatically not a shopping list of the\\ndesirable attributes that we’re looking for in a business. I’ve seen investment\\nchecklists that ask questions like: “Is this company cheap?” Or: “Does it have a\\nhigh return on equity?” In my opinion, this is a misguided way to use checklists.\\nI prefer to use them in much the same way that pilots use them. They don’t ask:\\n“Does this plane fly fast?” Or: “Am I flying to a sunny destination?” Rather, the\\nitems on their checklists are designed to help them avoid mistakes that have\\npreviously led to plane crashes. In investing too, the real purpose of a checklist is\\nto serve as a survival tool, based on the haunting remembrance of things past.\\nBut the best way to explain this is to provide you with some real-world\\nexamples of how I developed my checklist. Here, then, are four brief case\\nstudies—situations in which I made costly investment errors that then led me to\\ndevelop specific checklist items. The point is not just to relish this humbling\\naccount of various low points in my stock-picking career. It’s to get a clearer\\nsense of how you might analyze your mistakes and blind spots in order to\\nconstruct a checklist of your own.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Case Study One: The Man Who Lost His Cool\\nBack in 2001, when I was living in Manhattan, I began to make an array of\\ninvestments in companies that provided for-profit education. I traveled all over\\nthe world to learn more about these businesses, searching wide and deep for\\ngood companies in the same sector. I flew to Singapore, Shanghai, and Mumbai\\nto research one of the global leaders, Raffles Education Corporation, and I\\ndispatched my analyst to the Philippines. But it turned out that some of the most\\nintriguing companies in the industry were in my own backyard. I put together a\\nlist of all the for-profit educational institutions in New York City and went door-\\nto-door on my BMW motorcycle to check them out. At the time, I must have\\nknown more about the sector than almost any other investor in America. And I\\nloved riding that bike!\\nDuring these visits, I came across an obscure college called Interboro Institute,\\nwhich was owned by EVCI Career Holdings Corp. This company’s enterprising\\nmanagement team had come up with an innovative way of providing a college\\neducation to students with limited resources, many of whom had failed to\\ngraduate from high school. The students typically received financial aid grants\\nthat exceeded the cost of Interboro’s bare-bones education. So they were\\neducated for free while EVCI made money in the process. This model later came\\nunder fire. But I attended at least three graduation ceremonies at Interboro and\\nsaw for myself that it provided real social value. Essentially, it helped less-than-\\nstellar students to get a degree and move on to jobs in fields like medical billing\\nand insurance administration instead of remaining in menial work such as\\npacking groceries.\\nDuring the early stages of my research, I mentioned EVCI to Whitney Tilson,\\nand we ended up visiting the company together in Yonkers. The business was\\ndoing well, but EVCI was hobbled by $2 million in debt that it had issued to\\nacquire Interboro. In June 2003, Whitney and I invested $1 million each in', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='EVCI, which relieved the company of this debt burden and invigorated the\\nbusiness. Meanwhile, the number of students at Interboro grew rapidly, profits\\nsurged, and my $1 million investment soared to $7 million in 18 months.\\nThis was part of the benefit of running a small fund like Aquamarine: I could\\ntake a meaningful position in a tiny company like this, which operated way\\nbelow the radar of larger funds. It was thrilling, too, to see how my legwork had\\npaid off. All in all, this investment felt like a triumph. I felt really proud. When a\\nstock takes flight like this, there’s a sense of joyous wonder: “Wow,” you think.\\n“That’s real money.”\\nWith EVCI’s operating income and stock both up seven-fold, the board agreed\\nto grant huge pay rises to the company’s two top executives. The chairman/CEO\\nwould see his base salary leap from $326,000 a year to $621,000, and the\\npresident’s base salary would jump from $267,000 to $483,000. I was grateful\\nfor their astute management of the company up to that point, and I wanted them\\nto get rich alongside their investors. But this was a miniscule company that had\\ngenerated less than $3.5 million in operating profits the previous year. Their pay\\nhike meant that these two executives would now take roughly a quarter of the\\noperating profits in cash for themselves. To me and to other investors, that was\\nan outrageous amount for a company of this size. After all, who owns the\\ncompany? The management or the shareholders? In retrospect, I should have\\nsold my shares right then.\\nI was shocked and upset. This struck me as a short-sighted and self-serving\\nbusiness decision, and I fired off a forthright letter to the management and the\\nboard, describing the compensation plan (somewhat tactlessly) as “inane” and\\ncomplaining that it undermined investors’ confidence in them. For a start, I\\nexplained, the plan was financially inefficient since a big slug of the profits\\nwould now go to the IRS to pay income taxes. Even worse, these hefty salaries\\nwould have to be declared in the company’s proxy documents for all to read.\\nInterboro’s competitors were in the state sector, where educational administrators', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='had no opportunity to earn that kind of money. I was worried that these inflated\\nsalaries would spark resentment, not least among New York State’s education\\nauthorities. This could result in unwanted reviews of Interboro’s business and\\npossibly even a withdrawal of its education license.\\nMy letter suggested what seemed to me a compelling alternative. I said I was\\nwilling to use my influence as a substantial shareholder to pass a compensation\\nplan that would give the two top executives a generous grant of stock options. If\\nthe stock kept climbing, they could each make tens of millions of dollars. This\\nstruck me as a strong incentive and an appropriate reward for enriching their\\nshareholders. But I received no reply from the management or the board of\\ndirectors. I found this inexplicable. Here I was, offering to help them make a\\nfortune. Yet they didn’t even deign to respond.\\nConvinced that my arguments would win him over, I arranged to meet EVCI’s\\nchairman/CEO for lunch at a restaurant near his office in Yonkers. Our\\nconversation seemed cordial until suddenly all hell broke loose. He began\\nshouting at me at the top of his voice, and the whole restaurant fell into stunned\\nsilence. It felt like a scene from a movie. I don’t remember his exact words, but I\\nthink he yelled, “Are you accusing me of lying?” He also said something to the\\neffect of, “Who the hell do you think you are?”\\nI froze and had no idea how to react. I thought I was offering him an\\nopportunity to make enormous sums. In return, he seemed determined to\\nhumiliate me publicly. This was an astounding turn of events. What I discovered\\nmuch later was that he was going through a bitter divorce. According to a 2009\\ndecision from the New York Court of Appeals, he and his wife were fighting\\nover their marital assets, including his stock in EVCI. His wife commenced\\ndivorce proceedings in 2003, a trial ensued, and she was later granted a divorce\\non the grounds of abandonment. In 2006, the trial court “rejected” his “claims\\nthat the appreciation in the value of the EVCI stock was due solely to his\\nefforts,” and it used the trial date “for valuation purposes” of his stock and', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='options.\\nIn other words, he was in the midst of a wrenching war over money—and\\nspecifically over his stake in EVCI. This helps to explain why he blew up at me\\nwhen I proposed that he reverse the decision to increase his salary and instead\\nreceive a massive payday only if the stock performed well. Perhaps, his concern\\nwas that a major portion of this future wealth might end up going to his ex-wife.\\nIn any event, he must have felt under attack from every side. And, of course, we\\nknow how difficult it is to act rationally when money is at stake. In my opinion,\\nthe chairman/CEO was a smart and decent person. But it seemed to me that he\\nhad landed in a difficult position that didn’t bring out the best in him.\\nOur contentious lunch was an augury of more trouble to come. EVCI’s stock\\nsoon halved—at which point, I finally sold my shares. As I had predicted, the\\ncompany also lost favor with the state education authorities: in 2007 the New\\nYork Board of Regents enacted new test regulations that made it much harder for\\nInterboro students to receive financial aid. The company was also ordered to\\nrepay millions of dollars in student-aid funds after it turned out that some of its\\nstudents had been ineligible for the money they received. In December 2007 the\\nChronicle of Higher Education reported that EVCI had decided to close\\nInterboro down “after it realized that most of its students would no longer\\nqualify for state or federal student aid.” The company was also hit with a class-\\naction lawsuit for securities fraud. It was an ignominious end to what had once\\nseemed an inspiring success story.\\nLater, when I performed a postmortem on my various investing mistakes, I\\nreexamined what had happened at EVCI and tried to draw some practical lessons\\nfrom the experience. For me, one of the most important was that I needed to be\\nmore conscious of the extent to which the life circumstances of top executives\\ncan affect their decision making and their ability to manage the business. If I\\nhave even a mild argument with my wife, it can put me out of sorts for the day,\\naffecting both my mood and my ability to make intelligent decisions. So I can', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='only imagine how hard it would be to go through a contentious divorce. Indeed,\\nthis is just one example of the many life events that can knock an executive off\\ntrack: it might also be a family bereavement, a major dispute with a business\\npartner, or even extreme levels of personal debt.\\nLife is messy, and we all go through trying times. But it’s important to\\nrecognize that senior management—like the rest of us—can be derailed by this\\nkind of personal turmoil. After all, when a person’s back is up against the wall, it\\nincreases the likelihood that their judgment will suffer. So I added a couple of\\nitems to my checklist as a formal reminder of some hard-earned lessons,\\ncourtesy of this education company.\\nChecklist Items: Are any of the key members of the company’s management\\nteam going through a difficult personal experience that might radically affect\\ntheir ability to act for the benefit of their shareholders? Also, has this\\nmanagement team previously done anything self-serving that appears dumb?\\nCase Study Two: A Tortuous Tale of Tupperware\\nThe Tupperware Plastics Company was founded in 1938 by Earl Silas Tupper,\\nwho had previously worked at DuPont Chemical. He fashioned Tupperware’s\\nfirst containers out of polyethylene slag, a waste product from oil refining.\\nToday, his iconic brand of plastic containers is sold in about a hundred countries.\\nInstead of selling these goods in stores, the company’s strategy relies upon a\\nlegion of “consultants” who organize Tupperware “home parties,” at which the\\nhost receives free items in return for inviting guests to see the product line.\\nBack in the late ’90s, I became intrigued with Tupperware, which seemed to\\nembody all of the attributes of a high-quality business. I was particularly\\nimpressed with its exceptional profit margins and return on equity. Here was a\\ncompany that could take $5 worth of plastic and turn it into a piece of\\nTupperware that sold for $50. The company generated lots of cash, and it didn’t', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='need much capital. Plus, I remembered Munger talking about Tupperware parties\\nin his lecture on human misjudgment. He said these parties exemplified an array\\nof the “manipulative psychological tricks” that Robert Cialdini had discussed in\\nhis books. The overall effect was said to be so powerful that housewives bought\\nmasses of Tupperware despite its high price.\\nI wanted to experience this firsthand. So a friend and I hosted a Tupperware\\nparty in my apartment in New York. I was awed to see these psychological\\nforces at play. For a start, there was the reciprocation principle. As the hosts, we\\nknew that we’d get some free Tupperware, based on how much was sold at the\\nparty. So we were already grateful to the Tupperware lady for agreeing to\\norganize the event, and we were excited about the free containers we’d receive\\nas our reward. Then, at the start of the event, the Tupperware lady handed out a\\nsmall gift to everyone so that none of our guests would leave empty-handed. The\\nresult: everybody at the party was itching to reciprocate, just as Cialdini would\\nhave predicted.\\nAnother psychological force at play was the liking principle. We liked the\\nfriends we had invited, and they liked us. Once the Tupperware lady had handed\\nout free gifts, we all liked her too. Half an hour earlier she had been a complete\\nstranger; now she was not just a friend but a member of our team.\\nThe list goes on. For example, the authority principle was also at work since\\nshe knew a remarkable amount about food, which enhanced her authority as a\\nTupperware salesperson. There was also a scarcity factor at play since she hadn’t\\nbrought enough items to satisfy all of the demand among our guests. And did I\\nmention that the Tupperware containers came in all these really bright, vivid\\ncolors that also caught our attention? In short, the party was a brilliant example\\nof sales psychology at its most effective. In a couple of hours, our Tupperware\\nlady sold more than $2,000 worth of the product, earning herself nearly $1,000.\\nHaving seen this phenomenon in person, I felt that I understood why the\\ncompany was so successful: its superior performance was based on the', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='remarkable psychological effects unleashed at these parties. Plus, I could see that\\nthere was endless opportunity for Tupperware in emerging markets even though\\nthe developed world might already be saturated. Armed with these insights, I\\npretty much raced out to buy the stock. I was secure in the knowledge that every\\ntwo minutes someone was hosting a Tupperware party somewhere in the world,\\nand that these principles would be playing themselves out.\\nSadly, I was wrong. While some investments fail quickly, this one failed\\nslowly—and that can be far more damaging to an investment portfolio because\\nthese slow losers suck up an enormous amount of your mental energy over an\\nextended period of time. For as long as I owned Tupperware, one region or\\nanother was always performing badly. Sales simply weren’t growing. I would\\nlisten in on the company’s quarterly conference calls to find out what was going\\nwrong. These calls reassured me that management was highly competent and\\nworking hard. But as I gradually realized, the company faced a fundamental\\nproblem: there was too much competition, and the high price of its products had\\nbecome a serious obstacle to growth.\\nIt was only after a couple of years that I really figured out what was going on.\\nWhen Tupperware first hit the market, its products were unique. Customers\\nwillingly paid a premium for its promise of “sealed-in freshness.” But over the\\ndecades, many other competitors got into the game, and their seals improved\\nuntil they were just as good. These rival products may not have been as\\nattractive, but they were cheaper, and they were easily available in supermarkets.\\nAs a result, Tupperware could no longer justify its high price for a simple\\nproduct. Despite the management team’s abundant skills, they couldn’t alter this\\nharsh economic reality. As Buffett once remarked, “When a management team\\nwith a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad\\neconomics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.”\\nI finally capitulated in the summer of 1999, selling the stock for more or less\\nwhat I had paid for it a couple of years earlier. Looking back on this', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='disappointing investment, it was clear that I had failed to ask the most obvious\\nquestion: does this product offer good value for money? After the positive\\nexperience of hosting a Tupperware party, I had become too committed\\npsychologically to the idea of owning the stock, and I lacked the detachment to\\nsee the pitfalls.\\nThis misadventure taught me an invaluable lesson: I want to invest only in\\ncompanies that are a win-win for their entire ecosystem. In consultant speak,\\nwe’d refer to the ecosystem as “the value chain.” The terminology doesn’t\\nmatter. What’s important is the idea that a great company makes tons of money\\nwhile adding real value for its customers. Originally, Tupperware had done this\\nby introducing an innovative product. Now, no more.\\nBy contrast, consider a world-beating business like Wal-Mart (or, for that\\nmatter, Costco, GEICO, or Amazon.com). Wal-Mart works hard to make\\neverything it sells less expensive for the consumer, constantly driving more costs\\nout of its distribution system. This pleases its customers, so they bring more of\\ntheir business to Wal-Mart each year. You might think that Wal-Mart’s suppliers\\nwould be resentful since their margins are getting squeezed. But the suppliers\\nbenefit from the sheer volume of sales generated in Wal-Mart’s stores.\\nEverybody in this ecosystem wins: Wal-Mart and its shareholders, its suppliers,\\nand its customers. (That said, I’ve never owned Wal-Mart since the company\\nwas already too large and the stock too expensive to meet my criteria. And, of\\ncourse, Wal-Mart has critics who would argue that its success comes at the\\nexpense of local businesses and its own workforce.)\\nIn future, I determined to do a better job of analyzing the whole value chain to\\nidentify companies that make it more efficient. This analysis would have saved\\nme from my Tupperware mistake. It has also kept me away from companies as\\ndiverse as Philip Morris (a phenomenally profitable business that is damaging to\\nits customers’ health) and Greece’s national lottery firm OPAP (a phenomenally\\nprofitable business that is damaging to its customers’ wealth). Both of these', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='companies have a license to print money. But they do so by preying on people’s\\nweaknesses. For the consumer and for society at large, this is not a win-win\\nproposition.\\nPersonally, I don’t want to invest in companies that make society worse even\\nif their products are legal. Call me irrational, but I think it’s bad karma. In any\\ncase, I much prefer to invest in businesses that benefit society. Once again, in\\nlearning this lesson, I realized that Buffett already knew it; as far as I’m aware,\\nevery one of his holdings meets this high standard.\\nChecklist Item: Is this company providing a win-win for its entire ecosystem?\\nCase Study Three: What Lies Beneath?\\nMy study of companies like Wal-Mart and Costco led me to invest in CarMax—\\nthe Wal-Mart or Costco of secondhand cars. Since opening its first store in\\nVirginia in 1993, CarMax has sold over 4 million cars, and it currently boasts\\nabout a hundred stores across America. It’s a highly efficient operation with a\\nnarrow spread between what it pays for cars and the price at which it sells them.\\nCustomers know that the sales prices in its big-box stores are among the lowest\\naround. And there’s a huge selection of cars on display, ranging from two-year-\\nold Mercedes SUVs to Mustang convertibles from the 1950s.\\nThere is one other key aspect to the CarMax business model: it provides\\ncustomers with access to financing. In the United States, a significant portion of\\ncars are leased. Without financing, many CarMax customers wouldn’t be able to\\nbuy its cars. In fact, if CarMax were to find that it couldn’t access the debt\\nmarkets, its whole business model would fall apart. And in 2008 it did fall apart.\\nSales plummeted because CarMax and its customers could no longer obtain\\ncredit amid the global financial crisis. As a result, the stock price crashed.\\nOnce again, I discovered the importance of understanding a company’s entire\\nvalue chain. I hadn’t given sufficient thought to just how dependent CarMax was', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='on the credit markets, and how vulnerable this made the business. I might well\\nhave made the purchase anyway. After all, I could never have predicted the\\nseverity of the credit crisis. But this situation taught me how critical it is to\\ndiscern whether a business is overly exposed to parts of the value chain that it\\ncan’t control. If this is the case (as it often is), I need to be compensated for that\\nheightened risk with a lower purchase price.\\nIn response to this experience, I developed a checklist item that allows me to\\nget a deeper sense of the quality of the business. One way to word this item\\nmight be: “Are the company’s revenues leveraged to the credit markets?” But I\\ndon’t get too hung up on the exact wording that I use in my checklist. A more\\ngeneral version of this item might be: “How does this company sit within the\\nvalue chain, and what parts of this business could be impacted by changes in\\nother parts of the value chain that this company has very little influence over?”\\nThe point is that I want to invest in companies that control their own destiny,\\nnot in companies that have their destiny determined by forces beyond their\\ncontrol.\\nIt’s also possible to use this way of thinking to identify some great investment\\nopportunities. The goal in these situations is to find companies where one aspect\\nof the value chain has gone awry, dragging down the whole business. If I believe\\nthis problem is temporary, I can buy the stock at a beaten-down price and then\\nbenefit once this issue within the value chain is resolved.\\nIn 2007 this thought process led me to invest in Alaska Milk, the dominant\\nproducer of condensed milk in the Philippines. The company’s key ingredient\\nwas powdered milk that had to be imported from abroad. When the global price\\nof powdered milk shot up, the company’s profit margins were squeezed and its\\nstock plunged. I was convinced that the price of powdered milk would\\neventually return to normal as supply rose to match increased demand from\\nChina. As a result, Alaska Milk’s profits would rebound. This proved correct,\\nand I made about five times my money in five years.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Checklist Item: How could this business be affected by changes in other parts\\nof the value chain that lie beyond the company’s control? For example, are its\\nrevenues perilously dependent on the credit markets or the price of a particular\\ncommodity?\\nCase Study Four: How I Lost My Balance\\nSmart Balance, which has since been renamed Boulder Brands, was an\\ninnovative food company led by a superstar marketer named Stephen Hughes. Its\\nflagship product is a blend of vegetable and fruit oils that competes with leading\\nmargarines such as Shedd’s Country Crock and I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter.\\nSmart Balance’s spread is based on an oil-blending process patented by food\\nscientists at Brandeis University, and it offers a genuinely healthy alternative to\\nrival spreads that are rich in trans-fatty acids. By contrast, Smart Balance’s\\nspread is said to lower consumers’ “bad” cholesterol and to raise their “good”\\ncholesterol. Following its launch in 1997, it breezed past Land O’Lakes to\\nbecome the number-three brand in the margarine category.\\nAs a longtime shareholder of Nestlé, I had seen “functional” products like this\\nbecome a fast-growing and increasingly profitable niche within the food\\nindustry. I figured that Smart Balance, as a smaller and nimbler player, would\\ngrow rapidly for the next five or so years in both the margarine category and\\nrelated businesses such as peanut butter and popcorn. At that point, it would get\\nbought out by a larger competitor. I also liked the fact that Smart Balance had\\noutsourced its manufacturing and distribution, so it was a pure marketing and\\nbranding company. And its management team was quite something.\\nHughes enjoyed a remarkable reputation. He had famously turned around\\nTropicana’s juice business in the United States before achieving similarly\\nimpressive feats with brands like Celestial Seasonings tea and Silk Soymilk. An\\narticle about Smart Balance in Fortune began with the line, “Success has', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='followed Steve Hughes wherever he has roamed in the food industry over the\\npast two decades.” Hughes himself was quoted as saying, “We are positioning\\nthis as a brand that could grow to a billion dollars, a true mega-brand.”\\nBack then, I hadn’t yet abandoned my practice of meeting with management.\\nHughes came to my office, and I quickly fell under his spell. It wasn’t just that\\nhe had a superb résumé. He was also incredibly smart and charismatic—a\\nwonderful guy who, for good reason, was widely liked and admired. Already, his\\ntop-notch team had been successful in gaining distribution for Smart Balance at\\nWal-Mart, and I observed for myself how much shoppers there liked the brand.\\nAt the same time, an analyst who was working for me loved the stock and was\\ndesperate for me to buy it, partly because it was frustrating to work for a long-\\nterm investor who so rarely acquired a new holding. Confident that we had\\nfound a winner, I bought Smart Balance in 2007. There was just one problem. I\\noverpaid.\\nOf course, I didn’t realize this at the time. The stock had just fallen more than\\n30 percent from its peak. But it still traded at a high multiple of its current\\nearnings and cash flow. I made the classic mistake of thinking about the\\nvaluation in relative terms. I should simply have asked myself, “Is it cheap in\\nabsolute terms?” Instead, I reassured myself that it was relatively cheap now that\\nthe price had dropped from its highs. I was also banking on Hughes to justify\\nthis steep valuation by delivering on his ambitious growth targets. Given his—\\nand my—vision of a glorious future, I thought Smart Balance was a steal.\\nWhat followed was no catastrophe, but it was hardly the triumph I had\\nexpected. When the financial crisis struck, consumers reined in their spending on\\nhigher-priced items like Smart Balance margarine; instead of fretting about their\\nbad cholesterol, they fretted about their finances. It didn’t help that Smart\\nBalance’s rivals, stung by its success, retaliated with a price war that further\\neroded profits.\\nHughes and his team responded well in a tough environment. They kept a', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='careful watch on pricing. Seeing the importance of offering a cheaper product,\\nthey also acquired a value brand called Best Life. Throughout this difficult\\nperiod, the company generated a lot of free cash, which it deployed intelligently\\nfor marketing, debt reduction, and share repurchases. It was hard to complain,\\ngiven that they did everything right. Still, by the time I finally cashed out of the\\nstock in 2012 after five long years, I had lost about 30 percent of my money.\\nI had only myself to blame. I had paid a high entry price that was justified\\nonly if the company lived up to its full potential. I made the mistake of basing\\nmy investment on what this superstar manager might achieve with his promising\\nbrand instead of focusing on the value of the business as it existed at the time of\\nmy purchase. Without Hughes at the helm, knowledgeable buyers from within\\nthe food industry would probably have acquired Smart Balance for 60 to 70\\npercent of the price that I had paid to invest. I should have paid even less. This\\nwould have saved me a lot of heartache. I had also overlooked the reality that all\\nbrands are not created equal: Smart Balance was a fine brand with plenty of\\nupside, but it was no Nestlé.\\nI’ve bought many cheap stocks over the years, but I’m intermittently\\nastounded by my capacity to pay an excessive price for what I perceive to be a\\nhigh-quality business. This flaw lay at the heart of my mistake in buying Smart\\nBalance. A key lesson for me is that, in the long run, I will save an awful lot of\\nmoney if I succeed in countering this tendency to overpay. This should also save\\na lot of my brain cells. After all, if I pay too much up front, I’d better understand\\neverything there is to know about the company since there is no margin of safety.\\nIf I invest when it’s undervalued, I can be wrong about a whole host of issues\\nand still make a good return.\\nThis kind of self-awareness is vital since you can only design a checklist to\\naddress your weaknesses if you know what those weaknesses happen to be. To\\ncite a similar example, I also overpaid for shares in Discover Financial Services\\n(DFS), a credit card business that was spun out from Morgan Stanley in 2007. In', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='retrospect, I can see that one idiosyncratic reason why I was drawn to DFS was\\nthat it was so intellectually difficult to analyze: it was a highly profitable\\ncompany, but it’s such a complex business that it was virtually impossible to\\nknow whether the moat around it would widen or narrow. My internal\\nmonologue went something like this: “All these other investors think this stock\\nis too expensive. But they’re just not smart enough to appreciate the subtleties\\nthat make this such an incredible purchase. I, on the other hand, am not fearful of\\npaying a high price because I’m smarter and can understand the nuances that\\nthey’re missing.”\\nPeople like me—who pride ourselves on being clever and well educated—are\\nparticularly prone to this type of narcissistic hubris. We can easily get caught up\\nin analyzing companies that, like DFS, should really be relegated to what Buffett\\ncalls the “too hard” pile. Unfortunately, I wasn’t sufficiently aware of these\\ndangerous tendencies of mine back then. So I bought DFS at around $26 per\\nshare in January 2006 despite its analytical complexities. I soon came to regret\\nit.\\nAt the height of the credit crisis, the stock fell below $5, and I couldn’t be\\nabsolutely certain that the business would survive. I didn’t want to compound\\nmy mistake of overpaying for it with the equally dumb mistake of selling it\\nprematurely. So I held on. The stock rebounded sharply before I finally sold it in\\nNovember 2011 for around $24—not far from my original purchase price. Still, I\\ncould have avoided all of this pain and frustration if I had been more keenly\\naware of those dual weaknesses of mine: my tendency to overpay and my\\nirrational enthusiasm for analytical challenges that make me feel smart. These\\nbruising experiences with Smart Balance and DFS led me to add some additional\\nitems to my checklist.\\nChecklist Items: Is this stock cheap enough (not just in relative terms)?

It has apparently sold more than 1.2 million copies in the United States\\nalone and has been hailed by Fast Company as a “mega cult classic.” You can\\nget a flavor of its dark message by pondering “Law 14,” which recommends that\\nwe should “Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy.” A brief summary of this law\\nexplains: “Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable\\ninformation that will keep you a step ahead. Better still: Play the spy yourself. In\\npolite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to get people to\\nreveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occasion that is not an\\nopportunity for artful spying.”\\nIn some ways, this scheming Machiavellian, approach to life and business is\\nquite seductive. In my youth, there was a part of me that certainly identified with\\nit, fancying myself as a budding Gordon Gekko, with the intelligence and\\ncunning to manipulate my way to the top. And as my experience at D. H. Blair\\ntaught me, there is plenty of opportunity on Wall Street for cynical operators to\\nget rich by putting their own interests first. But as I later discovered, there is also\\na more enlightened path to success, even within the dog-eat-dog financial world\\n—an approach that I have come to think of as “The Buffett-Pabrai Way.”\\nBy observing Warren and Mohnish—both from a distance and up close—I\\ngradually learned to become a better investor, a better businessman, and (I hope)\\na better person. This process began when I first read Lowenstein’s biography of', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='Buffett during my time at D. H. Blair. That book changed me because it filled\\nmy head with Buffett’s thoughts, introducing me to the right person and the right\\nideas at a critical moment when I desperately needed guidance to get out of the\\nmoral maze in which I was lost. Indeed, the best way to learn is to surround\\nyourself with the right people. As Warren told Mohnish and me at our charity\\nlunch: “Hang out with people better than you, and you cannot help but improve.”\\nThose words have had an enormous impact on me. As Buffett helped me to\\nunderstand, nothing is more important than getting better people into your life.\\nTo put it another way, relationships are the killer app. Indeed, I’m convinced that\\nthis is the single most important way that we can tilt the playing field in our\\nfavor to achieve success as investors and in other areas of life. How, then, do we\\ncreate and nurture the right relationships so that we can learn from them what we\\nneed to learn and become who we ought to be?\\nI’m not sure that I fully grasped the overwhelming importance of our peer\\ngroup until I came across a fascinating book and a subsequent TED talk by\\nNicholas Christakis. He and his colleagues at Harvard had studied obesity in\\nhuman networks, and this research led them to an important discovery: if you\\nhave obese friends, you’re more likely to be obese. Similarly, if you have fit and\\nhealthy friends, you’re more likely to be fit and healthy. In other words, our\\nclose social connections count not only in the obvious ways, but also in subtle\\nways that we barely understand.\\nI have no doubt that this is also the case in business. If so, it stands to reason\\nthat I should make a conscious effort to have the best possible people in my\\nsocial networks. At first, I approached this idea in a calculated and self-serving\\nmanner, hoping that my attempts to build “social capital” would lead me to\\ngreater financial and professional success. But the relationships that I began to\\nform were so life enriching that my cynical motives gradually receded. I’m not\\nsaying that I’m Mahatma Gandhi. But my deepening bonds with great people\\nbecame a source of such sincere joy to me that I no longer needed any hidden', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='agenda: these friendships became a wonderful end in themselves, not a means to\\nself-advancement.\\nSerendipitously, I’m writing these words in the Delamar Greenwich Harbor\\nHotel in Connecticut—the very place where I had my first dinner with Mohnish\\na decade ago, on February 11, 2004. That meeting led to a friendship that has\\nbeen one of the greatest pleasures of my life—a relationship that really illustrates\\neverything that I hope to convey in this chapter.\\nJust yesterday, I received an email from Mohnish with the subject line: “Need\\nto put book on hold. The next idea is Upon Us!!!!” His five-word email message\\nthen named an Asian company, along with the phrase “a 4x!” In other words,\\nhe’d found a stock that he thought could go up four-fold, and he wanted me to\\nknow about it too. At the same time, he trusted me to look into it further and\\ngive him a useful second opinion, just as Buffett has, for decades, turned to\\nCharlie Munger—though, admittedly, the quality of the response might be a tad\\nhigher in Charlie’s case.\\nThink about this. Here is Mohnish, one of the great investors of our time,\\nhappily sharing his latest investment idea with me. At one level, this act of\\nkindness could be a tremendous financial gift for me and my shareholders if my\\nresearch leads me to the same conclusion and I buy the stock. But at a deeper\\nlevel, that simple email is a gift of true friendship—an act of sharing, trust,\\ngenerosity, and affection. This act is also built on an understanding of the\\nunsurpassed power of friendship—a recognition that, when we join together with\\ngood intentions, we are much more than the sum of our parts. As Mohnish often\\nsays, quoting an old adage that Ronald Reagan loved, “There’s no limit to what\\nyou can do if you don’t mind who gets the credit.” What more could I ask for\\nthan a friend like this?\\nI hope that I’m making this sufficiently clear because it’s almost certainly the\\nmost important point in this book—even though it may seem blindingly obvious\\nto you. Nothing, nothing at all, matters as much as bringing the right people into', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='your life. They will teach you everything you need to know.\\nIn countless ways, this relationship with Mohnish has been an eye-opening\\neducation for me. For example, over the past ten years, I’ve repeatedly observed\\nhow he looks to see what he can do for others, not the other way around. He\\nnever sat me down and explained the thinking behind this behavior. I simply\\nwitnessed how he acted with me and with others, and I tried my best to learn\\nfrom it. I saw how he would focus first on creating a real relationship and would\\nthen constantly look for ways to give, not take. He wasn’t pushy. He didn’t put\\npeople under any obligation. He seemed simply to ask himself, “What can I do\\nfor them?” Sometimes this was a kind word or a piece of advice; sometimes it\\nwas an introduction to someone else; sometimes it was a book that he would\\nsend as a gift and as a way of saying that he was thinking of that person.\\nBy acting in this way, I could see that Mohnish created an incredible network\\nof people who wish him well and would love to find ways to help him and thank\\nhim for his kindness. This is the extraordinarily powerful effect of compounding\\ngoodwill by being a giver, not a taker. And as he has taught me, the paradox is\\nthat you end up receiving infinitely more in life by giving than by taking.\\nThere’s a real irony here: in focusing on helping others, you end up helping\\nyourself too. For some people, this is not easy to understand. They act instead as\\nif life were a zero sum game, in which the person who gives something away is\\nthe poorer for it.\\nBuffett, of course, understands this perfectly, thanks in no small part to the\\ninfluence and example of his late wife, Susan, who was the kindest and most\\ngiving of people. After visiting her in hospital, he told a class at Georgia Tech,\\n“When you get to my age, you’ll really measure your success in life by how\\nmany of the people you want to have love you actually love you. I know people\\nwho have a lot of money, and they get testimonial dinners and they get hospital\\nwings named after them. But the truth is that nobody in the world loves them. If\\nyou get to my age in life and nobody thinks well of you, I don’t care how big', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='your bank account is, your life is a disaster. That’s the ultimate test of how you\\nhave lived your life.”\\nHe continued, “The trouble with love is that you can’t buy it. You can buy sex.\\nYou can buy testimonial dinners. You can buy pamphlets that say how wonderful\\nyou are. But the only way to get love is to be lovable. It’s very irritating if you\\nhave a lot of money. You’d like to think you could write a check: I’ll buy a\\nmillion dollars’ worth of love. But it doesn’t work that way. The more you give\\nlove away, the more you get.” Of all the lessons that Warren has taught me,\\nperhaps this is the most important.\\nAnybody who sees Buffett merely as a great stock picker is clearly missing the\\npoint. At our charity lunch, his kindness and generosity of spirit were\\nunmistakable. He was evidently determined to deliver much more value to us\\nthan we could possibly have hoped for or expected. He was there to give, both to\\nthe GLIDE Foundation and to us, not to receive. He wasn’t just polite and\\ncordial. He was there with every ounce of his being, trying to make this an\\noccasion that we would never forget. Here was one of the richest men in the\\nworld, a man who could gain nothing from us, yet he took the care to treat us\\nthis way.\\nI also saw this in the years that followed when he made the effort to give\\nMohnish and me a tour of his office or to send me a note that said something\\nlike, “Enjoyed reading your annual report, Guy.” This message, scrawled in a\\nfew seconds, was a small act of kindness that—coming from him—meant the\\nworld to me. If there’s a reward for acting this way, I would suggest that it’s\\nsimply the happiness and lightness of heart that he derives from this approach to\\nlife. I don’t believe that he behaves this way with any agenda. But Warren, like\\nMohnish, innately understands that this is the way the universe works: the more\\nwe give, the more we receive. Warren’s life is one of the great examples of this\\nbenevolent cycle.\\nBut perhaps the most important point to make here is that this is how we learn', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='—by watching people who are better than us, modeling their behavior, then\\nexperiencing for ourselves why their approach is wise and works. The point is\\nnot to lionize Warren or Mohnish, who have flaws and foibles just like the rest of\\nus. It’s to share this idea that there is no more important aspect of our education\\nas investors, businesspeople, and human beings than to find these exceptional\\nrole models who can guide us on our own journey. Books are a priceless source\\nof wisdom. But people are the ultimate teachers, and there may be lessons that\\nwe can only learn from observing them or being in their presence. In many\\ncases, these lessons are never communicated verbally. Yet you feel the guiding\\nspirit of that person when you’re with them.\\nOne of my favorite examples of this is from Li Lu’s introduction to the\\nChinese edition of Poor Charlie’s Almanack. He tells a wonderful anecdote\\nabout Charlie Munger in which, no matter how early he showed up for an\\nappointment, Munger was always there before him. Each time, Li Lu would\\nshow up earlier and earlier. And each time, Munger was already there.\\nEventually, Li Lu was showing up as much as one hour early, so they would each\\nread their newspapers separately until the meeting began at the appointed time.\\nApparently, Charlie had once been late for an important meeting through no fault\\nof his own, and he had vowed to himself never to let it happen again.\\nAs for Warren, he’s a social animal and has built an ecosystem around himself\\nof remarkable people who reflect and reinforce his own values. His inner circle\\nincludes Charlie Munger, Bill Gates, Ajit Jain, Debbie Bosanek, and Carol\\nLoomis. But there are many others too. These people look out for him, and he\\nlooks out for them. Again and again, he has proved to be an astute judge of\\ncharacter, allying himself with outstanding people and making amazingly few\\nmistakes. At times, I suspect that he bought certain companies not just because\\nthese were great businesses, but because they were run by great people whom he\\nwanted in this ecosystem—people like Thomas Murphy (who headed Capital\\nCities/ABC) and Rose Blumkin. He loved to tell stories about Blumkin’s', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='astonishing work ethic, and he clearly saw her as a role model.\\nIn my own experience, there are countless ways of improving the circles in\\nwhich we operate. Some of these are so obvious that it’s tempting not to mention\\nthem at all. But these simple, practical steps have made such a difference to my\\nlife that I’ll briskly mention some of them, even at the risk of sounding trite. For\\nexample, I joined various organizations where I could regularly rub shoulders\\nwith people who are better than me in a multitude of ways. This includes two\\nextraordinary business groups that teach leadership qualities: the Entrepreneurs’\\nOrganization and the Young Presidents’ Organization. I also joined Toastmasters,\\nwhich teaches leadership through public speaking. Likewise, I met with a\\nwonderful assortment of value investors once a month at Manhattan’s Colbeh\\nrestaurant as part of a group organized by Shai Dardashti. Some of my most\\nvaluable business relationships grew out of these monthly lunches.\\nHaving seen how much it helps to be part of a group like this, I later teamed\\nup with John Mihaljevic to create VALUEx as a place where “like-minded\\npeople can develop their worldly wisdom, learn to be better investors, and\\nbecome better people in the process.” The goal is to build a community in which\\nwe can all have a positive influence on one another. After all, it’s so much easier\\nto stay on track when you have support instead of going it alone. For similar\\nreasons, my family became members of the local Jewish community in Zurich.\\nAs Christakis had shown me, our peer group has a far-reaching influence on us.\\nSo I figured that being a member of a religious community would increase the\\nodds that we would elevate ourselves spiritually and morally as a family—much\\nas I figured that attending the annual meetings of Berkshire in Omaha and Wesco\\nin Pasadena would elevate me as an investor.\\nInitially, I had thought that participating in groups and events like these would\\nallow me to meet better people and that these contacts would help me to advance\\nmyself. Certainly, there are benefits to that kind of networking. But for me, the\\ngreatest benefit to hanging out in these positive environments was a more subtle', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='one: the opportunity to observe people who were far better at business and life\\nthan I was. This is one of the many reasons why attending Berkshire’s annual\\nmeeting is such a rich learning experience. For example, one year, I was having\\na drink in Omaha with a friend named Jonathan Brandt when I noticed that Don\\nKeough was standing nearby. Keough is a renowned business leader who has\\nserved on the boards of companies like Berkshire, Coca-Cola, and McDonald’s.\\nHe recognized Jonathan (whose father had been Buffett’s stockbrocker),\\nexchanged some thoughts with him, then took the trouble to introduce himself to\\nme. I had an electric feeling, as if all his energies were focused on me. For that\\ninstant, I felt like I was the only person who mattered to him.\\nOf course you could say that this was simply the polite and decent behavior\\nthat we should expect from anyone, which is true. But even a fleeting encounter\\nlike this helped me to discern some of the qualities that allow people to shine in\\nbusiness. For example, I could see from Keough’s impact on me just how\\nimportant it is to be fully present and engaged whenever I meet someone—\\nparticularly if that person is at an earlier stage in their career, or if they might be\\nill at ease. His example made me aspire to be better so that my own meetings\\nwith strangers might one day be similarly memorable and genuine.\\nLikewise, I’m struck by how often and enthusiastically Buffett speaks to MBA\\nstudents. It’s a time in their lives when they are particularly open to new ideas.\\nAnd if they haven’t yet secured a post-MBA job, they might also feel a little\\nvulnerable. So his generous spirit may mean all the more to them. There’s a great\\nlesson in this for me: if Warren can take the time to act like this with students\\n(not to mention with investors like me), then I too need to act with real kindness\\ntoward the students I meet at business schools, and I should also respond\\nencouragingly to every young graduate who sends me a résumé.\\nAt our lunch, Mohnish asked Warren how he’s managed to select the right\\npeople with whom to associate. Warren replied that he can survey a room filled\\nwith a hundred people and easily identify the ten he’d do business with and the', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='ten he’d avoid. The other 80 would go into his “not sure” category. At the time, I\\ndidn’t find this insight particularly satisfying. But I later realized that I should\\nhave applied this thinking before going to work for D. H. Blair. There had been\\nenough smoke to raise real concerns about the existence of fire, including the\\ncritical article I had read about the firm in the New York Times. On that basis\\nalone, the company and its charismatic leader Morty Davis should have gone\\ninto my own “not sure” category. Temperamentally, I like to be fair and to give\\npeople the benefit of the doubt. But in this instance, circumspection would have\\nserved me better. In any case, the key lesson from Warren was to invest time and\\nenergy in the handful of people you’re sure about and leave the rest alone.\\nOn this basis, I decided that I needed to become more efficient at eliminating\\npeople from my network if I wasn’t sure about them. The first place where I\\napplied this idea was in my hiring process. I had originally assumed that the\\nright way to hire is to place an advertisement and then sift through the many\\nrésumés that came my way, trying to give every candidate the benefit of the\\ndoubt. After all, this is how consulting firms and investment banks did it when\\nthey went about hiring people like me. But one well-documented problem with\\nthis approach is that a high proportion of these job candidates have some\\nattribute that makes them hard to employ while the best candidates get snapped\\nup fast. Those who don’t get snapped up fast also tend to get better at disguising\\ntheir flaws, which become harder and harder to discern.\\nSo I stopped advertising. Instead, I ended up hiring people whose behavior I\\nhad a chance to observe in unguarded moments. For example, I hired Dan Moore\\nas an analyst after contacting him about a piece of equity research he had done.\\nHe wouldn’t share it with me because I wasn’t a client of his buy-side firm. The\\nexemplary way that he handled this situation showed me the high quality of his\\nethics and his loyalty to his employer. This insight into his character was a key\\nreason for my offering him a job. Likewise, I hired Orly Hindi, my director of\\noperations, after meeting her at a Colbeh dinner, where I saw how gracefully she', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='handled a difficult social encounter. This provided me with a perfect example of\\nher remarkable people skills. Indeed, my most successful hires have happened\\nnot because I advertised the position, but because I observed the person in\\ncandid moments like these, when they were simply being themselves.\\nAt the same time, I also consciously moved away from dealing with anyone\\nwho struck me as mysterious or opaque in any way. In my impressionable youth,\\nI had a number of glittering, socially prominent “friends” who were obscure\\nabout who they really were. After leaving Oxford, I was naïvely dazzled by\\nsomeone who claimed to be a Tatar prince. That summer, we gallivanted around\\nLondon and the French Riviera, meeting other supposed princes and princesses.\\nI found it exciting, and I enjoyed the feeling that I was entering these rarefied\\nsocial circles. In a way, it was just a bit of frivolous fun, but it was also mildly\\npernicious to be captivated by this world of superficial glamour.\\nMohnish showed me a better way. In his view, life is just too short to deal with\\npeople who aren’t straightforward and forthcoming about who they are. The best\\nstrategy is simply to leave the mysterious obfuscators alone. The goal is not to\\nfigure them out, but to keep a distance. Warren and Mohnish, who are both\\ndown-to-earth and entirely lacking in pretense, are only interested in dealing\\nwith people who are an open book. They distance themselves from all the others,\\nleaving them in the “not sure” category, which is the human equivalent of the\\n“too hard” box on Warren’s desk.\\nBefore I have an appointment with a person I don’t already know, I typically\\nprovide them with written information about myself—for example, my bio and\\nmy fund’s annual report. I want to make it as easy as possible for them to see\\nwhere I’m coming from and to form an accurate impression of me. Likewise, I\\nroutinely ask them to send me some background material about themselves. If\\npeople are enigmatic or elusive in any way, I apply Buffett’s “not sure” rule and\\ndecide against a closer relationship.\\nBy the same token, I hope they will see that I really am who I appear to be—', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='not a fake who deceives either himself or others. I want to be the same person on\\nthe inside as on the outside. In business, as in other areas of life, I would argue\\nthat we attract people who are similar to us, who reflect the level of our own\\nconsciousness. If I strive to be honest and decent, I’m more likely to bring into\\nmy life people who are honest and decent. This helps to explain why Buffett has\\ndrawn such remarkable people into his orbit: they provide a reflection of who he\\nis.\\nBy observing Mohnish, I also learned another key lesson about how to behave,\\nboth in business and in other areas of life. I could see that he was never needy or\\ndemanding in the way that he dealt with people. There was no sense of\\nentitlement or desire to encroach on their time. In the early days of our\\nrelationship, I’d call him in California and say apologetically, “I hope you’re not\\nbusy and that I’m not disturbing you.” He’d reply, “Busy? On the contrary, I was\\njust twiddling my thumbs.” It wasn’t true, but it was his way of making me feel\\nthat nothing was more important than my call. Indeed, on countless occasions,\\nI’ve received emails in which he says, “Call if you’re twiddling.” Similarly,\\nwhen we traveled to Omaha to meet Debbie Bosanek for lunch in 2010, he wrote\\nto her, “Our schedule is very flexible. . . . Feel free to suggest whatever is ideal\\nfor u.”\\nThis isn’t a question of being sycophantic or losing his own sense of self. On\\nthe contrary, Mohnish has a healthy ego. But I’ve repeatedly seen how careful he\\nis not to impose himself on others or to ride roughshod over their interests. He\\nwants to show up only where he’s needed or wanted. He takes great care not to\\nbe a burden to anyone or to make them feel that they have any obligation to him.\\nWatching him act like this had a profound impact on me because I could see so\\nclearly that it was a great way to behave. I remember discussing with him a\\nsituation in which an investor wanted to sell his stake in my fund. My father\\ninitially suggested that I try to dissuade the person. But Mohnish told me, “Don’t\\ntry to convince them. It’s their money. If they want to take it out, let them do it,', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='no questions asked.” The relationship with my investor might have been ending,\\nbut Mohnish helped me to see that there should be no guilt or recrimination—\\nand, above all, no sense of obligation.\\nThis simple but robust idea has radiated out into many other areas of my life.\\nTo give you just one example, I never try to solicit my friends (or anyone else,\\nfor that matter) to invest in my fund. I’m happy for them just to be my friends.\\nThere is never any obligation.\\nYet, looking back, I can see how appallingly needy I was in my early years as\\na fund manager. Back then, I had somehow convinced myself that it was\\nimportant to sell myself and my fund to prospective investors, as if this brazen\\npushiness were an integral part of being a smart businessman and a high-flying\\nfund manager. In reality, this was just an embarrassing example of my neediness.\\nI also came to see what a turn-off it had been when I cold-called someone in an\\nattempt to drum up business, or when I sent out a mass email in the vain hope of\\nseizing the attention of prospective investors who had expressed no interest at all\\nin the fund. This can only have made it less likely that discerning people would\\nwant to establish closer ties with me.\\nBy contrast, I love the story of Ian Jacobs, a Columbia Business School\\ngraduate who successfully applied for a job with Buffett at Berkshire’s\\nheadquarters. Along with his cover letter, Jacobs apparently enclosed a check to\\nrecompense Warren for his time in evaluating this job application. Some people\\nsaw this as a ridiculous gimmick. But the check—which I’m sure was never\\ncashed—would have instantly communicated the message that Jacobs respected\\nthe value of Buffett’s time. It was a powerful signal that he did not want to be a\\nburden.\\nThis is a smart way to act, not least because people get defensive when they\\nsense that we want something from them or harbor a hidden agenda. I began to\\nrealize that my attempts to grab attention or impose myself on others were\\nparticularly annoying when I was dealing with important people since they are', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='so often targeted in this way. Not long ago, I had an unforgettable lunch with the\\nCEO of a major bank. Early in our meeting, I told him sincerely that I just felt so\\nblessed in my life and so fortunate to be there with him. He relaxed visibly when\\nhe realized that I wasn’t angling for anything but just wanted to enjoy his\\ncompany. The key, in my experience, is to value people as an end in themselves,\\nnot as a means to our own ends.\\nMohnish often quotes a beautiful line from the Bible, “I am but dust and\\nashes.” Now, like me, he’s a work in progress, and there’s a hint of irony in his\\nvoice when he says this—as if to acknowledge that he has not quite reached this\\nlevel of humility and self-abnegation. Neither of us could lay convincing claims\\nto sainthood quite yet. Still, I’ve repeatedly seen his desire to serve others and\\nnot to put his needs above theirs. His example has helped me to understand that\\nit’s possible to be a servant without losing your autonomy, self-respect, or\\nambition. In my early years as a fund manager, I would have mocked the idea of\\nbeing a servant. I preferred to see myself as a smart manipulator. But at our\\ncharity lunch Warren was also a servant of sorts despite being the world’s most\\nfamous investor.\\nThanks in large part to Mohnish and Warren, I began to realize that I ought to\\nfocus more on what others need from me instead of constantly trying to get them\\nto fulfill my own needs. This might sound obvious, but it’s been a huge\\npsychological shift for me, and it’s really changed the way that I live my life.\\nIn my New York vortex days, I would go to a networking event, meet a\\nstranger, and wonder how they could help me. Often, they’d talk at me about\\nwhatever product or service they wanted to sell, and I started to see how\\nrepulsive this sort of agenda-driven approach to business can be. So, over time, I\\ndeveloped a different attitude to networking. My simple rule was that, whenever\\nI met someone, I would try to do something for them. It might simply be an\\nintroduction to someone else or even just a sincere compliment. What was\\nintriguing to me was the way they reacted. In some cases, I sensed that they were', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='saying to themselves, “That’s nice. I wonder what else this guy is going to do for\\nme, or what else I can ask him for.” In other cases, I could see that they wanted\\nto help me too. These seemingly trivial interactions provided a barometer of\\nwhether people approached the world as givers or takers.\\nAt first, I attracted a high proportion of takers. For a while, I found myself\\ngetting ridiculously upset about it, wondering why they didn’t understand that\\nthis was a lousy way to live. But by observing people closely, I gradually\\nbecame a better judge of who was a giver and who was a taker, and I began to\\nattract better people into my life. I hope this doesn’t sound more calculated than\\nit is. Because what I’m trying to do is simply create an ecosystem for myself in\\nwhich everybody is the type of person who wants to find ways of helping others.\\nWhen you’re surrounded by people like this, all of them trying to help one\\nanother, it sometimes feels like heaven on earth. People like Mohnish or John\\nMihaljevic, for example, are just gems—always looking to help, to support, to\\nshare. These are the keepers. The people we want in our inner circle. The people\\nwe should fly across the world to see if they live abroad. And, of course, this is\\nwhat I need to be for others.\\nThe crazy thing is that, when you start to live this way, everything becomes so\\nmuch more joyful. There is a sense of flow and alignment with the universe that\\nI never felt when everything was about what I could take for myself. Again, I\\ndon’t want to make this sound like I’m some kind of saint. But this experience of\\nfinding ways to serve others has been so overwhelmingly positive that I now\\nfind myself looking for more and more opportunities to help. These days, my\\nfocus isn’t just on helping individuals but also organizations, such as my Oxford\\ncollege, Harvard Business School, and the Weizmann Institute. I recently\\nrealized that the Entrepreneurs’ Organization doesn’t have a chapter in Israel, so\\nI set one up. I also learned that there was no TEDx event in Zurich, so I\\ncofounded one.\\nI’m not telling you this to be self-congratulatory as there are countless people', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='who do so much more good than I do. The point is simply that my life has\\nimproved immeasurably since I began to live this way. In truth, I’ve become\\nincreasingly addicted to the positive emotions awakened in me by these\\nactivities. I also love the deepening sense of connection that I’ve gained to so\\nmany great people and institutions. One thing is for sure: I receive way more by\\ngiving than I ever did by taking. So, paradoxically, my attempts at selflessness\\nmay actually be pretty selfish.\\nWarren and Mohnish, who are two of the smartest guys on earth, clearly\\nunderstand this. As an investor and a businessman, Warren’s achievements are\\nalmost inconceivable. Yet his greatest legacy may well be his philanthropic work\\nin supporting the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which could affect\\nmillions of people. Likewise, Mohnish hasn’t devoted his considerable gifts to\\nthe single-minded pursuit of wealth. His Dakshana Foundation is already\\ntransforming the lives of countless young Indians, giving them opportunities that\\nmight otherwise be unthinkable. He has told me more than once that he would\\nprefer to be remembered for Dakshana than as an investor.\\nThe goal for the rest of us is not to be Warren Buffett or Mohnish Pabrai, but\\nto learn from them. In big ways and small, I’ve come to see them both as grand\\nmasters in the game of life. To repeat that all-important line from Warren, “Hang\\nout with people better than you, and you cannot help but improve.”', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='13', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='THE QUEST FOR TRUE VALUE\\nIf your goal in life is to get rich, value investing is pretty hard to beat. Sure, there\\nare times when it falls out of favor, when even the greatest practitioners find\\nthemselves dismissed as fusty has-beens who have lost their touch. But it’s such\\na robust and fundamentally sound way to invest that it eventually regains its\\nluster. Irrational exuberance comes and goes. The quest for value endures.\\nStill, this is not just a stock-picking strategy that can make you rich. To me,\\neven the phrase itself—“value investing”—implies something deeper than\\nmerely accumulating the millions required to buy a mansion in Greenwich, a ski\\nchalet in Gstaad, and a gleaming Ferrari. As Warren Buffett’s life exemplifies,\\nwhat we are also talking about here is a quest for true value—for some kind of\\nmeaning that goes beyond money, professional advancement, or social cachet.\\nI don’t mean to dismiss or deride those things. While I’m slightly sheepish\\nabout my baser, more capitalist instincts, I’m not that sheepish . . . I do still drive\\na convertible Porsche, even though I’m mildly embarrassed to admit it. And I’m\\nso obsessed with my pursuit of the perfect cappuccino that I spent $6,000 on an\\nexquisite La Marzocco coffee machine, which I imported from Florence. I try to\\njustify these excesses by contemplating the image of Sir John Templeton—who\\ngave a fortune to charity—driving a Rolls Royce. Of course, even Buffett bought\\na private jet, which he self-mockingly named “The Indefensible.” (Later, having\\nchanged his mind, he rechristened it “The Indispensable.”) And, for that matter,\\nCharlie Munger spent millions on a luxury catamaran called the “Channel Cat.”\\nIf stuff like this turns you on, then value investing is a great means to your\\nself-indulgent ends. Enjoy. As I see it, this is the outer journey of the value\\ninvestor—the quest for wealth, physical comfort, and (for want of a better word)\\nsuccess. But it’s important not to get so caught up in this meaningless chase that', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='we forget what matters most—the inner journey toward something less tangible\\nyet more valuable. The inner journey is the path to becoming the best version of\\nourselves that we can be, and this strikes me as the only true path in life. It\\ninvolves asking questions such as: What is my wealth for? What gives my life\\nmeaning? and how can I use my gifts to help others?\\nRelatively early in his investing career, Buffett closed down his limited\\npartnerships and returned the assets to his shareholders. Even then, he just\\nwasn’t that interested in the unbridled pursuit of wealth. Clearly, it’s not money\\nthat makes him tap dance to work. Likewise, Munger has said that, once you’ve\\nmade a certain amount (I think it was $100 million), there would have to be\\nsomething wrong in your head for you to continue dedicating yourself to the\\naccumulation of wealth. Templeton also devoted much of his life to the inner\\njourney. Indeed, his greatest legacy is his charitable foundation, which explores\\n“the Big Questions of human purpose and ultimate reality,” including\\ncomplexity, evolution, infinity, creativity, forgiveness, love, gratitude, and free\\nwill. The foundation’s motto is “How little we know, how eager to learn.”\\nIn my experience, the inner journey is not only more fulfilling but is also a key\\nto becoming a better investor. If I don’t understand my inner landscape—\\nincluding my fears, insecurities, desires, biases, and attitude to money—I’m\\nlikely to be mugged by reality. This happened early in my career, when my greed\\nand arrogance led me to D. H. Blair. My desperate need to appear successful\\nthen made it difficult to admit my mistake and leave the company quickly after\\nconcluding that it was a morally corrosive environment. Later, in my New York\\nvortex years, my envy of people with bigger funds and more glamorous homes\\nled me astray again, convincing me that I needed to market myself and try to\\nbecome something that wasn’t true to who I am.\\nBy embarking on the inner journey, I became more self-aware and began to\\nsee these flaws more clearly. I could work to overcome them only once I\\nacknowledged them. But these traits were so deep-seated that I also had to find', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='practical ways to navigate around them. For example, by moving to Zurich, I\\nphysically removed myself from an environment in Manhattan that exacerbated\\nmy greed and envy. Knowing that cities like New York and London—the\\nepicenters of Extremistan—had this destabilizing effect on me, it seemed safest\\nto get away.\\nBut this is an ongoing process. As I write, my wife is exploring the possibility\\nof moving our family to London so that we can be closer to my parents, my\\nsister, and our children’s cousins. In some ways, this scares me. Will I be able to\\ndeal with the emotional turmoil that London, with its extremes of wealth, might\\nstir in me? Have I grown enough internally that I can move there without being\\nemotionally destabilized? Can I create a peaceful environment for myself even\\nwithin London—for example, in a quiet suburb, far from the reality distortion of\\nthe “super-prime” areas—where my mind can remain a calm pond? At the\\nmoment, the answers are unclear. But this is all part of my inner journey as I\\ngrapple with the idiosyncrasies that make it hard for me to be a rational investor.\\nIgnorance is not bliss when it comes to investing because the financial markets\\nare mercilessly effective at exposing these emotional weaknesses. During the\\ncredit crisis, for example, it was vital to understand my own complex attitude to\\nmoney since this affected my judgment and my ability to deal with the\\npsychological impact of the crashing stock market. Intellectually, it’s easy\\nenough to master the technical tools of investing—the ability to read balance\\nsheets, say, and to identify undervalued companies. But what good are these\\nskills to investors who are drowning in a sea of fear that utterly overwhelms the\\nrational neocortex?\\nTaking personal responsibility rather than blaming others is crucial. Instead of\\ncriticizing the fickle shareholders who bailed out of my fund at the bottom of the\\nmarket, it was much more useful for me to think carefully about what it would\\nmean to me if the market continued to crash and I had to close my fund. Why\\nwould it be so unbearably painful?', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='For me, this inner aspect of the market meltdown was very different than it\\nwas for Mohnish, who seemed entirely unaffected by the plunging prices of the\\nstocks in his portfolio. As Mohnish tells it, he spent an important part of his\\nyouth witnessing the many ups and downs of his father’s business career.\\nApparently, there were multiple occasions when his father was on the brink of\\nfinancial collapse or actually went broke. Yet even amid that tumult, his family\\ninteractions were remarkably serene. So for Mohnish, the prospect of financial\\ndisaster is not as emotionally fraught as it might be for me. One happy result of\\nhis emotional fortitude was that he was able to keep buying busted stocks at a\\npoint when other investors might have been more inclined to curl up in a fetal\\nposition in a quiet corner of the office.\\nMy own attitude to money is deeply influenced by the painful history of\\nEuropean Jewry. My great-grandparents were wealthy German industrialists who\\nowned a major hat factory outside Berlin. Then the Nazis seized their assets and\\ndestroyed their life of privilege. My family escaped to Israel (then Palestine),\\nwhere they set about reconstructing what they had lost. My grandfather, who had\\nbeen a lawyer in Germany, became an unsuccessful Israeli chicken farmer. I\\ngrew up hearing tales of food shortages and of young men going off to defend\\nthe country during those early years in Israel. My father, having grown up on his\\nparents’ chicken farm, spent much of his career as a corporate salary man; he\\nthen started a business that generated excess cash, which I invested for him. By\\nnow, I’ve multiplied our family’s wealth five-fold. But I still have a deep-seated\\nfear that factors beyond my control could sweep everything away.\\nWhy does any of this matter? Because this narrative subtly but powerfully\\nshapes my entire approach to business and investing. For example, I never use\\nborrowed money, and all my investments are sober and conservative. For me, the\\nstory of my family and money has been one of restoration—of fixing the damage\\nthat Hitler wrought. I feel a tremendous sense of responsibility when it comes to\\nmy family’s finances (most of which are invested in my fund), not least because', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='I’m attempting to repair what was shattered more than 70 years ago and to\\nprovide enduring security in an insecure world. I love what I do, but this is a\\nserious business for me. And we know that money is closely associated with\\nsurvival in the human mind, so these emotional issues have the potential to\\ntorpedo my rational brain. By contrast, Mohnish can buy stocks with a higher\\nlevel of uncertainty and volatility since, for him, the possibility of loss doesn’t\\ntrigger the kind of fears that are hardwired into my system.\\nI would argue that serious investors need to understand the complexities of\\ntheir relationship to money, given its capacity to wreak havoc. Based on that\\nunderstanding, we can make adjustments—for example, changing our physical\\nenvironment or adding certain items to our investment checklist. But I’m not\\nconvinced that it’s entirely possible to change the wiring itself, however smart\\nwe might be. I certainly haven’t managed it yet. I used to think that I could\\novercome my fear of financial loss, thereby freeing myself to take more risk and\\nachieve higher returns. But I’ve gradually come to accept that this is just part of\\nwho I am. There’s no doubt that Warren and Mohnish have inner landscapes that\\nbetter equip them to make clearheaded decisions involving money. But I can’t\\nspend my life yearning to be them. Instead, I need to understand what makes me\\ndifferent, then make investments that I can handle emotionally, based on this\\nself-knowledge.\\nIn the end, I handled the financial crisis well, partly because I confronted my\\nfears of loss and found ways to work around them. If I hadn’t been aware of this\\naspect of my inner life, I might have panicked when a stock like Discover\\nFinancial Services fell 80 percent. Instead, I held steady as it rebounded. Having\\ngained a deeper sense of who I am, I’ve also stopped worrying about trying to\\nget the best returns. I’m more comfortable aiming for decent returns that beat the\\nmarket indexes over the long term despite my personal limitations. Similarly,\\nI’ve always invested a hefty portion of my fund in Berkshire Hathaway. Given\\nthe company’s enormous size, I could probably get better returns by investing', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='elsewhere. But Berkshire’s presence in my portfolio provides a ballast—both\\nfinancially and emotionally. It’s psychologically important to have Buffett in my\\necosystem. Is this rational? For me, yes. For Mohnish, maybe not.\\nGiven the importance of this inner journey, how—in practical terms—should\\nwe go about it? Personally, I’ve used countless tools to accelerate this process of\\ninward growth, and I’ve found them all helpful (or interesting) at different stages\\nof my life. I’ve done lots of psychotherapy, even though this would have\\nappalled me in my closed-minded youth. Among other things, I did seven years\\nof Jungian therapy once a week, and I’ve dabbled in things like emotionally\\nfocused therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, neurolinguistic programming, and\\neven eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. As I came to realize,\\nhumans are infinite in their variety, and there is an almost infinite variety of\\ntherapies to help us undertake this journey.\\nI’ve also delved into religion with various rabbis and other spiritual teachers,\\nincluding my friend Isaac Sassoon, who is the author of a book called\\nDestination Torah: Reflections on the Weekly Torah Readings. I’ve had regular\\nsessions with career coaches. I’ve studied philosophy and became friends with\\nLou Marinoff, a “philosophical counselor” who is the author of Plato, Not\\nProzac! Applying Eternal Wisdom to Everyday Problems. And I’ve read\\ncountless self-help books. Temperamentally, I’m not well suited to meditation.\\nBut I’m open to pretty much anything as long as I might learn something.\\nAnother fantastic tool for internal growth is the experience of adversity.\\nIndeed, this should really be the first tool of all. If we take responsibility for our\\nmistakes and failures, they offer priceless opportunities to learn about ourselves\\nand how we need to improve. My mistake in joining D. H. Blair, for example,\\nenabled me to see that I had to deal with my avarice and also stop measuring\\nmyself by an outer scorecard. Adversity may, in fact, be the best teacher of all.\\nThe only trouble is that it takes a long time to live through our mistakes and then\\nlearn from them, and it’s a painful process.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='For me, the greatest springboard for the inner journey has been to participate\\nin what Napoleon Hill would call a “mastermind” group.

On one memorable occasion, I gave a 20-minute presentation about\\nmy tortured relationship with a key business associate who was also a close\\nfriend from university. The group then subjected me to two rounds of clarifying\\nquestions, which left all the details of the relationship out in the open for them to\\nexamine. My chest burned with anger.

Many thanks to everyone from TED who has touched my life, including Chris\\nAnderson, Li Lu, Hugo Schotman, June Cohen, Jason Wishnow, Tom Wujec, Erik Brenninkmeijer, Lisa\\nStringle, Jane Wulf, Maya Elhalal-Levavi, Janet Echelman, Kathryn Schulz, Abigail Tenembaum, Claudia\\nMarcelloni, Robert Gupta, Katherine McCartney, Lior Zoref, Michael Weitz, and Alex Knight. It was also\\nthrough TED that I connected to my friend Rolf Dobelli of Zurich Minds, which has become another\\nextraordinary force for change in my life.\\nPARTNERS, FRIENDS, AND FORUM MATES\\nI have been privileged to have a wonderful group of friends and forum mates who have taught me countless\\nlessons about investing, business, and life.

My goal\\nhere is simply to share with you a selection of books that have had an impact on me and that have enriched\\nmy life. This is a decidedly idiosyncratic list, ranging from seminal works on investing to esoteric studies of\\ncomplexity, psychology, and games. It’s not a comprehensive list by any means. But I hope you’ll find\\nmuch in here that’s useful, enlightening, and life-enhancing.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='INVESTING\\nThe Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing by Benjamin Graham is where it all started\\nfor me. Four other books that deserve to be read and reread many times are Seth Klarman’s Margin of\\nSafety: Risk-Averse Value Investing Strategies for the Thoughtful Investor; Joel Greenblatt’s You Can be a\\nStock Market Genius: Uncover the Secret Hiding Places of Stock Market Profits; The Aggressive\\nConservative Investor by Martin J. Whitman, Martin Shubik, and Gene Isenberg; and John Mihaljevic’s The\\nManual of Ideas: The Proven Framework for Finding the Best Value Investments. Before I discovered value\\ninvesting, I was also captivated by two other investment classics: Edwin Lefèvre’s Reminiscences of a Stock\\nOperator and The Alchemy of Finance by George Soros.\\nHEROES, MENTORS, AND ROLE MODELS\\nRoger Lowenstein’s biography Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist was the first book that I\\nconsciously used to help me “model” Warren Buffett. Other seminal works on Buffett include Alice\\nSchroeder’s The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life and Tap Dancing to Work: Warren\\nBuffett on Practically Everything, 1966–2013 by his friend Carol Loomis, a renowned writer who worked at\\nFortune for 60 years. There is also a deep well of wisdom from Buffett in Berkshire Hathaway Letters to\\nShareholders, 1965–2013. Another marvelous glimpse inside the mind of a master is Poor Charlie’s\\nAlmanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger, which includes his eye-opening analysis of the\\ncauses of human misjudgment.\\nINNER EXPLORATIONS\\nThe best guide to “forum” is Mo Fathelbab’s Forum: The Secret Advantage of Professional Leaders. The\\ntitle says it all. But I highly recommend that you discover the power of such mastermind groups by joining\\none. Some of the best are run by the Entrepreneurs’ Organization and the Young Presidents’ Organization,\\nwhich devote enormous resources to helping their members have a positive forum experience. Toastmasters\\nworks slightly differently but is also excellent. (It’s also a lot more egalitarian and a lot less expensive.)\\nAlcoholics Anonymous, which I have not attended, produces a wonderful book entitled Twelve Steps and\\nTwelve Traditions. Although created to help recovering alcoholics, its lessons are applicable to everyone.\\nSELF-HELP\\nIt’s tempting for cerebral people to raise their eyebrows at the very thought of self-help books, but I’ve\\nfound a great deal of practical wisdom within this genre. For me, the central figure here is Tony Robbins.\\nAwaken the Giant Within: How to Take Immediate Control of Your Mental, Emotional, Physical, and\\nFinancial Destiny! provides as good an introduction as any to his ideas, as do his various recordings. But to\\nexperience the full benefit of what he has to teach, I would recommend attending one of his seminars.', metadata={'source': 'book2'}), Document(page_content='PSYCHOLOGY\\nWe all embark on the inner journey without a good road map. But there are signposts. I first began to\\ndiscover this rich territory when I read The Grail Legend by Emma Jung and Marie-Louise von Franz,\\nfollowed by The Fisher King and the Handless Maiden: Understanding the Wounded Feeling Function in\\nMasculine and Feminine Psychology by Robert Johnson. During my seven-year stint in Jungian therapy, I\\nfound Edward Whitmont’s The Symbolic Quest: Basic Concepts of Analytical Psychology a very useful\\nhandbook. My first explorations into the power of emotion came from reading Diana Fosha’s The\\nTransforming Power of Affect: A Model for Accelerated Change, which then led me to works by Allan\\nSchore, Antonio Damasio, Joseph LeDoux, and others, some of which I’ve listed below.\\nA RANDOM WALK THROUGH MY LIBRARY\\nWhat follows is a brief list of additional books that I’ve found intriguing and enriching for countless\\nreasons. Are they relevant to your education as an investor? Some yes. Some not so much. But I’ve found\\nall of these books richly rewarding.

Both were just starting out on their careers, and\\nboth were struggling with money and families. But they had very\\ndifferent points of view about money.\\nFor example, one dad would say, “The love of money is the root\\nof all evil.” The other said, “The lack of money is the root of all evil.”\\nAs a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me\\nwas difficult. I wanted to be a good son and listen, but the two fathers\\ndid not say the same things. The contrast in their points of view,\\nparticularly about money, was so extreme that I grew curious and\\nintrigued. I began to start thinking for long periods of time about\\nwhat each was saying.\\nMuch of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself\\nquestions such as, “Why does he say that?” and then asking the same\\nquestion of the other dad’s statement. It would have been much\\neasier to simply say, “Yeah, he’s right. I agree with that.” Or to simply\\nreject the point of view by saying, “The old man doesn’t know what\\nhe’s talking about.” Instead, having two dads whom I loved forced\\nme to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking for myself. As a\\nprocess, choosing for myself turned out to be much more valuable in\\nthe long run than simply accepting or rejecting a single point of view.\\nOne of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and\\nthe middle class struggles in debt is that the subject of money is\\ntaught at home, not in school. Most of us learn about money from\\nour parents. So what can poor parents tell their child about money?\\nThey simply say, “Stay in school and study hard.” The child may\\ngraduate with excellent grades, but with a poor person’s financial\\nprogramming and mindset.\\nSadly, money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic\\nand professional skills, but not on financial skills. This explains how\\nsmart bankers, doctors, and accountants who earned excellent grades\\nmay struggle financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt\\nis due in large part to highly educated politicians and government\\nofficials making financial decisions with little or no training in the\\nsubject of money.\\n2', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nToday I often wonder what will soon happen when we have\\nmillions of people who need financial and medical assistance. They\\nwill be dependent upon their families or the government for financial\\nsupport. What will happen when Medicare and Social Security run\\nout of money? How will a nation survive if teaching children about\\nmoney continues to be left to parents—most of whom will be, or\\nalready are, poor?\\nBecause I had two influential fathers, I learned from both of\\nthem. I had to think about each dad’s advice, and in doing so, I\\ngained valuable insight into the power and effect of one’s thoughts on\\none’s life. For example, one dad had a habit of saying, “I can’t afford\\nit.” The other dad forbade those words to be used. He insisted I ask,\\n“How can I afford it?” One is a statement, and the other is a question.\\nOne lets you off the hook, and the other forces you to think. My\\nsoon-to-be-rich dad would explain that by automatically saying the\\nwords “I can’t afford it,” your brain stops working. By asking the\\nquestion “How can I afford it?” your brain is put to work. He did\\nnot mean that you should buy everything you want. He was fanatical\\nabout exercising your mind, the most powerful computer in the\\nworld. He’d say, “My brain gets stronger every day because I exercise\\nit. The stronger it gets, the more money I can make.” He believed that\\nautomatically saying “I can’t afford it” was a sign of mental laziness.\\nAlthough both dads worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a\\nhabit of putting his brain to sleep when it came to finances, and the\\nother had a habit of exercising his brain. The long-term result was\\nthat one dad grew stronger financially, and the other grew weaker. It\\nis not much different from a person who goes to the gym to exercise\\non a regular basis versus someone who sits on the couch watching\\ntelevision. Proper physical exercise increases your chances for health,\\nand proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth.\\nMy two dads had opposing attitudes and that affected the way\\nthey thought. One dad thought that the rich should pay more in\\ntaxes to take care of those less fortunate. The other said, “Taxes\\npunish those who produce and reward those who don’t produce.”\\n3', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Introduction\\nOne dad recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good\\ncompany to work for.” The other recommended, “Study hard so you\\ncan find a good company to buy.”\\nOne dad said, “The reason I’m not rich is because I have you\\nkids.” The other said, “The reason I must be rich is because I have\\nyou kids.”\\nOne encouraged talking about money and business at the dinner\\ntable, while the other forbade the subject of money to be discussed\\nover a meal.\\nOne said, “When it comes to money, play it safe. Don’t take\\nrisks.” The other said, “Learn to manage risk.”\\nOne believed, “Our home is our largest investment and our\\ngreatest asset.” The other believed, “My house is a liability, and if your\\nhouse is your largest investment, you’re in trouble.”\\nBoth dads paid their bills on time, yet one paid his bills first while\\nthe other paid his bills last.\\nOne dad believed in a company or the government taking care\\nof you and your needs. He was always concerned about pay raises,\\nretirement plans, medical benefits, sick leave, vacation days, and\\nother perks. He was impressed with two of his uncles who joined the\\nmilitary and earned a retirement-and-entitlement package for life\\nafter twenty years of active service. He loved the idea of medical\\nbenefits and PX privileges the military provided its retirees. He also\\nloved the tenure system available through the university. The idea\\nof job protection for life and job benefits seemed more important,\\nat times, than the job. He would often say, “I’ve worked hard for the\\ngovernment, and I’m entitled to these benefits.”\\nThe other believed in total financial self-reliance. He spoke out\\nagainst the entitlement mentality and how it created weak and financially\\nneedy people. He was emphatic about being financially competent.\\nOne dad struggled to save a few dollars. The other created\\ninvestments. One dad taught me how to write an impressive resumé\\nso I could find a good job.

I noticed\\nthat people really do shape their lives through their thoughts.\\nFor example, my poor dad always said, “I’ll never be rich.” And\\nthat prophecy became reality. My rich dad, on the other hand, always\\nreferred to himself as rich. He would say things like, “I’m a rich man,\\nand rich people don’t do this.” Even when he was flat broke after a\\nmajor financial setback, he continued to refer to himself as a rich man.\\nHe would cover himself by saying, “There is a difference between\\nbeing poor and being broke.

My rich dad taught me over a period of 30 years\\nuntil I was 39 years old. He stopped once he realized that I knew and fully\\nunderstood what he had been trying to drum into my often-thick skull.\\nMoney is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial\\neducation. Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about\\nhow money works, you gain power over it and can begin building\\nwealth. The reason positive thinking alone does not work is because\\nmost people went to school and never learned how money works, so\\nthey spend their lives working for money.\\nBecause I was only nine years old when I started, the lessons my rich\\ndad taught me were simple. And when it was all said and done, there\\nwere only six main lessons, repeated over 30 years. This book is about\\nthose six lessons, put as simply as possible, just as simply as my rich dad\\nput forth those lessons to me.

I could tell he was thinking.\\n“Well, Son…,” he began slowly. “If you want to be rich, you have\\nto learn to make money.”\\n“How do I make money?” I asked.\\n“Well, use your head, Son,” he said, smiling. Even then I knew\\nthat really meant, “That’s all I’m going to tell you,” or “I don’t know\\nthe answer, so don’t embarrass me.”\\nA Partnership Is Formed\\nThe next morning, I told my best friend, Mike, what my dad had\\nsaid. As best as I could tell, Mike and I were the only poor kids in this\\nschool. Mike was also in this school by a twist of fate. Someone had\\ndrawn a jog in the line for the school district, and we wound up in\\nschool with the rich kids. We weren’t really poor, but we felt as if we\\nwere because all the other boys had new baseball gloves, new bicycles,\\nnew everything.\\nMom and Dad provided us with the basics, like food, shelter,\\nand clothes. But that was about it. My dad used to say, “If you want\\nsomething, work for it.” We wanted things, but there was not much\\nwork available for nine-year-old boys.\\n“So what do we do to make money?” Mike asked.\\n“I don’t know,” I said. “But do you want to be my partner?”\\nHe agreed, and so on that Saturday morning, Mike became my\\nfirst business partner. We spent all morning coming up with ideas\\non how to make money. Occasionally we talked about all the “cool\\nguys” at Jimmy’s beach house having fun. It hurt a little, but that hurt\\nwas good, because it inspired us to keep thinking of a way to make\\nmoney. Finally, that afternoon, a bolt of lightning struck. It was an\\nidea Mike got from a science book he had read. Excitedly, we shook\\nhands, and the partnership now had a business.\\n10', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nFor the next several weeks, Mike and I ran around our neighborhood,\\nknocking on doors and asking our neighbors if they would save their\\ntoothpaste tubes for us. With puzzled looks, most adults consented with a\\nsmile. Some asked us what we were doing, to which we replied, “We can’t\\ntell you. It’s a business secret.”\\nMy mom grew distressed as the weeks wore on. We had selected a\\nsite next to her washing machine as the place we would stockpile our\\nraw materials. In a brown cardboard box that at one time held catsup\\nbottles, our little pile of used toothpaste tubes began to grow.\\nFinally my mom put her foot down. The sight of her neighbors’\\nmessy, crumpled, used toothpaste tubes had gotten to her. “What are you\\nboys doing?” she asked. “And I don’t want to hear again that it’s a business\\nsecret. Do something with this mess, or I’m going to throw it out.”\\nMike and I pleaded and begged, explaining that we would soon\\nhave enough and then we would begin production. We informed her\\nthat we were waiting on a couple of neighbors to finish their toothpaste\\nso we could have their tubes. Mom granted us a one-week extension.\\nThe date to begin production was moved up, and the pressure was\\non. My first partnership was already being threatened with an eviction\\nnotice by my own mom! It became Mike’s job to tell the neighbors to\\nquickly use up their toothpaste, saying their dentist wanted them to\\nbrush more often anyway. I began to put together the production line.\\nOne day my dad drove up with a friend to see two nine-year-old\\nboys in the driveway with a production line operating at full speed.\\nThere was fine white powder everywhere. On a long table were small\\nmilk cartons from school, and our family’s hibachi grill was glowing\\nwith red-hot coals at maximum heat.\\nDad walked up cautiously, having to park the car at the base of\\nthe driveway since the production line blocked the carport. As he and\\nhis friend got closer, they saw a steel pot sitting on top of the coals in\\nwhich the toothpaste tubes were being melted down. In those days,\\ntoothpaste did not come in plastic tubes. The tubes were made of\\nlead. So once the paint was burned off, the tubes were dropped in the\\nsmall steel pot. They melted until they became liquid, and with my\\n11', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter One: Lesson 1\\nmom’s pot holders, we poured the lead through a small hole in the\\ntop of the milk cartons.\\nThe milk cartons were filled with plaster of paris. White powder\\nwas everywhere. In my haste, I had knocked the bag over, and the\\nentire area looked like it had been hit by a snowstorm. The milk\\ncartons were the outer containers for plaster of paris molds.\\nMy dad and his friend watched as we carefully poured the molten\\nlead through a small hole in the top of the plaster of paris cube.\\n“Careful,” my dad said.\\nI nodded without looking up.\\nFinally, once the pouring was through, I put the steel pot down\\nand smiled at my dad.\\n“What are you boys doing?” he asked with a cautious smile.\\n“We’re doing what you told me to do. We’re going to be rich,”\\nI said.\\n“Yup,” said Mike, grinning and nodding his head. “We’re partners.”\\n“And what is in those plaster molds?” my dad asked.\\n“Watch,” I said. “This should be a good batch.”\\nWith a small hammer, I tapped at the seal that divided the cube\\nin half. Cautiously, I pulled up the top half of the plaster mold and a\\nlead nickel fell out.\\n“Oh, no!” my dad exclaimed. “You’re casting nickels out of lead!”\\n“That’s right,” Mike said. “We’re doing as you told us to do. We’re\\nmaking money.”\\nMy dad’s friend turned and burst into laughter. My dad smiled\\nand shook his head.

Keep going. I’m really proud\\nof you!”\\nDisappointed, Mike and I sat in silence for about twenty minutes\\nbefore we began cleaning up our mess. The business was over on\\nopening day. Sweeping the powder up, I looked at Mike and said,\\n“I guess Jimmy and his friends are right. We are poor.”\\nMy father was just leaving as I said that. “Boys,” he said. “You’re\\nonly poor if you give up. The most important thing is that you did\\nsomething. Most people only talk and dream of getting rich. You’ve\\ndone something. I’m very proud of the two of you. I will say it again:\\nKeep going. Don’t quit.”\\nMike and I stood there in silence. They were nice words, but we\\nstill did not know what to do.\\n“So how come you’re not rich, Dad?” I asked.\\n“Because I chose to be a schoolteacher. Schoolteachers really don’t\\nthink about being rich. We just like to teach. I wish I could help you,\\nbut I really don’t know how to make money.”\\nMike and I turned and continued our cleanup.\\n“I know,” said my dad. “If you boys want to learn how to be\\nrich, don’t ask me. Talk to your dad, Mike.”\\n“My dad?” asked Mike with a scrunched-up face.\\n“Yeah, your dad,” repeated my dad with a smile. “Your dad\\nand I have the same banker, and he raves about your father. He’s\\ntold me several times that your father is brilliant when it comes to\\nmaking money.”\\n“My dad?” Mike asked again in disbelief. “Then how come we\\ndon’t have a nice car and a nice house like the rich kids at school?”\\n“A nice car and a nice house don’t necessarily mean you’re rich or\\nyou know how to make money,” my dad replied. “Jimmy’s dad works for\\n13', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter One: Lesson 1\\nthe sugar plantation.

The sugar company is in financial trouble, and Jimmy’s dad may\\nsoon have nothing. Your dad is different, Mike.

With new vigor, we began\\ncleaning up the mess caused by our now-defunct first business. As we\\nwere cleaning, we made plans for how and when to talk to Mike’s dad.\\nThe problem was that Mike’s dad worked long hours and often did not\\ncome home until late.

It was the restaurants\\nthat kept him out late.\\nMike caught the bus home after we had finished cleaning up.

Across from the women sat a man in workman’s\\nclothes. He wore khaki slacks and a khaki shirt, neatly pressed but\\nwithout starch, and polished work boots. He was about 10 years older\\nthan my dad. They smiled as Mike and I walked past them toward the\\nback porch. I smiled back shyly.\\n“Who are those people?” I asked.\\n“Oh, they work for my dad. The older man runs his warehouses,\\nand the women are the managers of the restaurants. And as you\\narrived, you saw the construction supervisor who is working on a\\nroad project about 50 miles from here. His other supervisor, who is\\nbuilding a track of houses, left before you got here.”\\n“Does this go on all the time?” I asked.\\n“Not always, but quite often,” said Mike, smiling as he pulled up\\na chair to sit down next to me.\\n“I asked my dad if he would teach us to make money,” Mike said.\\n“Oh, and what did he say to that?” I asked with cautious curiosity.\\n“Well, he had a funny look on his face at first, and then he said he\\nwould make us an offer.”\\n“Oh,” I said, rocking my chair back against the wall. I sat there\\nperched on two rear legs of the chair.\\nMike did the same thing.\\n“Do you know what the offer is?” I asked.\\n“No, but we’ll soon find out.”\\nSuddenly, Mike’s dad burst through the rickety screen door and\\nonto the porch.

On two sides of the store, the doors had to be wide open to the\\nroad and parking lot. Every time a car drove by or pulled into the\\nparking lot, dust would swirl and settle in the store. We knew we had\\na job as long as there was no air-conditioning.\\nFor three weeks, Mike and I reported to Mrs. Martin and worked\\nour three hours.

You are a crook like everyone in town thinks you are.\\nYou’re greedy. You want all the money and don’t take care of your\\nemployees. You made me wait and don’t show me any respect.

Not understanding what he was saying, I\\ncontinued with my grievance. “I thought you were going to keep\\nyour end of the bargain and teach me. Instead you want to torture\\nme? That’s cruel. That’s really cruel.”\\n“I am teaching you,” rich dad said quietly.\\n“What have you taught me? Nothing!” I said angrily. “You haven’t\\neven talked to me once since I agreed to work for peanuts. Ten cents an\\nhour. Hah! I should notify the government about you. We have child\\nlabor laws, you know. My dad works for the government, you know.”\\n“Wow!” said rich dad. “Now you sound just like most of the people\\nwho used to work for me—people I’ve either fired or who have quit.”\\n“So what do you have to say?” I demanded, feeling pretty brave\\nfor a little kid. “You lied to me. I’ve worked for you, and you have not\\nkept your word. You haven’t taught me anything.”\\n“How do you know that I’ve not taught you anything?” asked rich\\ndad calmly.\\n“Well, you’ve never talked to me. I’ve worked for three weeks and\\nyou have not taught me anything,” I said with a pout.\\n“Does teaching mean talking or a lecture?” rich dad asked.\\n“Well, yes,” I replied.\\n“That’s how they teach you in school,” he said, smiling. “But\\nthat is not how life teaches you, and I would say that life is the best\\nteacher of all. Most of the time, life does not talk to you. It just sort\\nof pushes you around. Each push is life saying, ‘Wake up. There’s\\nsomething I want you to learn.’”\\n19', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter One: Lesson 1\\n“What is this man talking about?” I asked myself silently. “Life\\npushing me around was life talking to me?” Now I knew I had to quit\\nmy job. I was talking to someone who needed to be locked up.\\n“If you learn life’s lessons, you will do well. If not, life will just\\ncontinue to push you around. People do two things. Some just let life\\npush them around. Others get angry and push back. But they push\\nback against their boss, or their job, or their husband or wife. They\\ndo not know it’s life that’s pushing.”\\nI had no idea what he was talking about.\\n“Life pushes all of us around. Some people give up and others\\nfight. A few learn the lesson and move on. They welcome life pushing\\nthem around. To these few people, it means they need and want to\\nlearn something. They learn and move on. Most quit, and a few like\\nyou fight.”\\nRich dad stood and shut the creaky old wooden window that\\nneeded repair. “If you learn this lesson, you will grow into a wise,\\nwealthy, and happy young man. If you don’t, you will spend your\\nlife blaming a job, low pay, or your boss for your problems. You’ll\\nlive life always hoping for that big break that will solve all your\\nmoney problems.”\\nRich dad looked over at me to see if I was still listening. His eyes\\nmet mine. We stared at each other, communicating through our eyes.\\nFinally, I looked away once I had absorbed his message. I knew he\\nwas right. I was blaming him, and I did ask to learn. I was fighting.\\nRich dad continued, “Or if you’re the kind of person who has\\nno guts, you just give up every time life pushes you. If you’re that\\nkind of person, you’ll live all your life playing it safe, doing the right\\nthings, saving yourself for some event that never happens. Then you\\ndie a boring old man. You’ll have lots of friends who really like you\\nbecause you were such a nice hardworking guy. But the truth is that\\nyou let life push you into submission. Deep down you were terrified\\nof taking risks. You really wanted to win, but the fear of losing was\\ngreater than the excitement of winning.

I have more than 150 employees, and not\\none of them has asked me what I know about money. They ask me for\\na job and a paycheck, but never to teach them about money. So most\\nwill spend the best years of their lives working for money, not really\\nunderstanding what it is they are working for.”\\nI sat there listening intently.\\n“So when Mike told me you wanted to learn how to make money,\\nI decided to design a course that mirrored real life. I could talk until\\nI was blue in the face, but you wouldn’t hear a thing. So I decided to\\nlet life push you around a bit so you could hear me. That’s why I only\\npaid you 10 cents.”\\n“So what is the lesson I learned from working for only 10 cents an\\nhour?” I asked. “That you’re cheap and exploit your workers?”\\nRich dad rocked back and laughed heartily. Finally he said,\\n“You’d best change your point of view. Stop blaming me and thinking\\nI’m the problem. If you think I’m the problem, then you have to\\nchange me. If you realize that you’re the problem, then you can\\nchange yourself, learn something, and grow wiser. Most people want\\neveryone else in the world to change but themselves. Let me tell you,\\nit’s easier to change yourself than everyone else.”\\n“I don’t understand,” I said.\\n“Don’t blame me for your problems,” rich dad said, growing impatient.\\n“But you only pay me 10 cents.”\\n“So what are you learning?” rich dad asked, smiling.\\n“That you’re cheap,” I said with a sly grin.\\n“See, you think I’m the problem,” said rich dad.\\n21', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter One: Lesson 1\\n“But you are.”\\n“Well, keep that attitude and you’ll learn nothing. Keep the\\nattitude that I’m the problem and what choices do you have?”\\n“Well, if you don’t pay me more or show me more respect and\\nteach me, I’ll quit.”\\n“Well put,” rich dad said. “And that’s exactly what most people\\ndo. They quit and go looking for another job, a better opportunity,\\nand higher pay, actually thinking that this will solve the problem. In\\nmost cases, it won’t.”\\n“So what should I do?” I asked. “Just take this measly 10 cents an\\nhour and smile?”\\nRich dad smiled. “That’s what the other people do. But that’s all\\nthey do, waiting for a raise thinking that more money will solve their\\nproblems. Most just accept it, and some take a second job working\\nharder, but again accepting a small paycheck.”\\nI sat staring at the floor, beginning to understand the lesson\\nrich dad was presenting. I could sense it was a taste of life. Finally,\\nI looked up and asked, “So what will solve the problem?”\\n“This,” he said, leaning forward in his chair and tapping me\\ngently on the head. “This stuff between your ears.”\\nIt was at that moment that rich dad shared the pivotal point of\\nview that separated him from his employees and my poor dad—and\\nled him to eventually become one of the richest men in Hawaii, while\\nmy highly educated but poor dad struggled financially all his life.\\nIt was a singular point of view that made all the difference over\\na lifetime.\\nRich dad explained this point of view over and over, which I call\\nlesson number one: The poor and the middle class work for money. The\\nrich have money work for them.\\nOn that bright Saturday morning, I learned a completely different\\npoint of view from what I had been taught by my poor dad. At the age\\nof nine, I understood that both dads wanted me to learn. Both dads\\nencouraged me to study, but not the same things.\\n22', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nMy highly educated dad recommended that I do what he did.\\n“Son, I want you to study hard, get good grades, so you can find a\\nsafe, secure job with a big company. And make sure it has excellent\\nbenefits.” My rich dad wanted me to learn how money works so I\\ncould make it work for me.\\nThese lessons I would learn through life with his guidance, not\\nbecause of a classroom.\\nMy rich dad continued my first lesson, “I’m glad you got angry\\nabout working for 10 cents an hour. If you hadn’t got angry and had\\nsimply accepted it, I would have to tell you that I could not teach you.\\nYou see, true learning takes energy, passion, and a burning desire. Anger\\nis a big part of that formula, for passion is anger and love combined.\\nWhen it comes to money, most people want to play it safe and feel\\nsecure. So passion does not direct them. Fear does.”\\n“So is that why they’ll take jobs with low pay?” I asked.\\n“Yes,” said rich dad. “Some people say I exploit people because\\nI don’t pay as much as the sugar plantation or the government. I\\nsay the people exploit themselves. It’s their fear, not mine.”\\n“But don’t you feel you should pay them more?” I asked.\\n“I don’t have to. And besides, more money will not solve their\\nproblems. Just look at your dad. He makes a lot of money, and he\\nstill can’t pay his bills. Most people, given more money, only get into\\nmore debt.”\\n“So that’s why the 10 cents an hour,” I said, smiling. “It’s a part\\nof the lesson.”\\n“That’s right,” smiled rich dad. “You see, your dad went to school\\nand got an excellent education, so he could get a high-paying job. But\\nhe still has money problems because he never learned anything about\\nmoney in school. On top of that, he believes in working for money.”\\n“And you don’t?” I asked.\\n“No, not really,” said rich dad. “If you want to learn to work for\\nmoney, then stay in school. That is a great place to learn to do that.\\nBut if you want to learn how to have money work for you, then I will\\nteach you that. But only if you want to learn.”\\n23', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter One: Lesson 1\\n“Wouldn’t everyone want to learn that?” I asked.\\n“No,” said rich dad, “simply because it’s easier to learn to work for\\nmoney, especially if fear is your primary emotion when the subject of\\nmoney is discussed.”\\n“I don’t understand,” I said with a frown.\\n“Don’t worry about that for now. Just know that it’s fear that keeps\\nmost people working at a job: the fear of not paying their bills, the fear\\nof being fired, the fear of not having enough money, and the fear of\\nstarting over. That’s the price of studying to learn a profession or trade,\\nand then working for money. Most people become a slave to money—\\nand then get angry at their boss.”\\n“Learning to have money work for you is a completely different\\ncourse of study?” I asked.\\n“Absolutely,” rich dad answered. “Absolutely.”\\nWe sat in silence on that beautiful Hawaiian Saturday morning. My\\nfriends had just started their Little League baseball game, but for some\\nreason I was now thankful I had decided to work for 10 cents an hour.\\nI sensed that I was about to learn something my friends wouldn’t learn\\nin school.\\n“Ready to learn?” asked rich dad.\\n“Absolutely,” I said with a grin.\\n“I have kept my promise. I’ve been teaching you from afar,” my rich\\ndad said. “At nine years old, you’ve gotten a taste of what it feels like to\\nwork for money. Just multiply your last month by fifty years and you\\nwill have an idea of what most people spend their life doing.”\\n“I don’t understand,” I said.\\n“How did you feel waiting in line to see me, once to get hired and\\nonce to ask for more money?”\\n“Terrible,” I said.\\n“If you choose to work for money, that is what life will be like,” said\\nrich dad.\\n“And how did you feel when Mrs. Martin dropped three dimes in\\nyour hand for three hours of work?”\\n24', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\n“I felt like it wasn’t enough. It seemed like nothing. I was\\ndisappointed,” I said.\\n“And that is how most employees feel when they look at their\\npaychecks—especially after all the tax and other deductions are taken\\nout. At least you got 100 percent.”\\n“You mean most workers don’t get paid everything?” I asked\\nwith amazement.\\n“Heavens no!” said rich dad. “The government always takes its\\nshare first.”\\n“How do they do that?” I asked.\\n“Taxes,” said rich dad. “You’re taxed when you earn. You’re\\ntaxed when you spend. You’re taxed when you save. You’re taxed\\nwhen you die.”\\n“Why do people let the government do that to them?”\\n“The rich don’t,” said rich dad with a smile. “The poor and the\\nmiddle class do. I’ll bet you that I earn more than your dad, yet he\\npays more in taxes.”\\n“How can that be?” I asked. At my age, that made no sense to me.\\n“Why would someone let the government do that to them?”\\nRich dad rocked slowly and silently in his chair, just looking at me.\\n“Ready to learn?” he asked.\\nI nodded my head slowly.\\n“As I said, there is a lot to learn. Learning how to have money work\\nfor you is a lifetime study. Most people go to college for four years,\\nand their education ends.

They think\\nthat more money will solve the problem and don’t realize that it’s their\\nlack of financial education that is the problem.”\\n“So my dad has tax problems because he doesn’t understand\\nmoney?” I asked, confused.\\n25', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter One: Lesson 1\\n“Look,” said rich dad, “taxes are just one small section on learning\\nhow to have money work for you. Today, I just wanted to find out if\\nyou still have the passion to learn about money.

That’s the price of only\\nknowing how to work for money instead of studying how to have\\nmoney work for you. So do you still have the passion to learn?” asked\\nrich dad.\\nI nodded my head.\\n“Good,” said rich dad. “Now get back to work. This time, I will\\npay you nothing.”\\n“What?” I asked in amazement.\\n“You heard me. Nothing.

Now\\nget out of here and get back to work.”\\nLesson #1: The Rich Don’t Work for Money\\nI didn’t tell my poor dad I wasn’t being paid. He wouldn’t have\\nunderstood, and I didn’t want to try to explain something I didn’t\\nunderstand myself.\\nFor three more weeks, Mike and I worked three hours every\\nSaturday for nothing. The work didn’t bother me, and the routine\\ngot easier, but it was the missed baseball games and not being able\\nto afford to buy a few comic books that got to me.\\nRich dad stopped by at noon on the third week. We heard his\\ntruck pull up in the parking lot and sputter when the engine was\\nturned off. He entered the store and greeted Mrs. Martin with a hug.\\nAfter finding out how things were going in the store, he reached into\\nthe ice-cream freezer, pulled out two bars, paid for them, and signaled\\nto Mike and me.\\n“Let’s go for a walk, boys.”\\nWe crossed the street, dodging a few cars, and walked across a\\nlarge grassy field where a few adults were playing softball.

If you don’t, you’ll wind up like Mrs. Martin and most of\\nthe people playing softball in this park. They work very hard for little\\nmoney, clinging to the illusion of job security and looking forward to a\\nthree-week vacation each year and maybe a skimpy pension after forty-\\nfive years of service. If that excites you, I’ll give you a raise to 25 cents\\nan hour.”\\n“But these are good hardworking people. Are you making fun of\\nthem?” I demanded.\\nA smile came over rich dad’s face.\\n“Mrs. Martin is like a mother to me. I would never be that cruel.\\nI may sound unkind because I’m doing my best to point something out\\nto the two of you. I want to expand your point of view so you can see\\nsomething most people never have the benefit of seeing because their\\nvision is too narrow. Most people never see the trap they are in.”\\nMike and I sat there, uncertain of his message. He sounded cruel,\\nyet we could sense he was trying to drive home a point.\\nWith a smile, rich dad said, “Doesn’t that 25 cents an hour sound\\ngood? Doesn’t it make your heart beat a little faster?”\\nI shook my head no, but it really did. Twenty-five cents an hour\\nwould be big bucks to me.\\n“Okay, I’ll pay you a dollar an hour,” rich dad said, with a sly grin.\\nNow my heart started to race. My brain was screaming, “Take it.\\nTake it.” I could not believe what I was hearing. Still, I said nothing.\\n“Okay, two dollars an hour.”\\nMy little brain and heart nearly exploded. After all, it was 1956\\nand being paid $2 an hour would have made me the richest kid in\\nthe world. I couldn’t imagine earning that kind of money. I wanted to\\nsay yes. I wanted the deal. I could picture a new bicycle, new baseball\\nglove, and the adoration of my friends when I flashed some cash.\\nOn top of that, Jimmy and his rich friends could never call me poor\\nagain. But somehow my mouth stayed shut.\\nThe ice cream had melted and was running down my hand. Rich\\ndad was looking at two boys staring back at him, eyes wide open and\\nbrains empty. He was testing us, and he knew there was a part of our\\n28', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nemotions that wanted to take the deal. He understood that every\\nperson has a weak and needy part of their soul that can be bought,\\nand he knew that every individual also had a part of their soul that\\nwas resilient and could never be bought. It was only a question of\\nwhich one was stronger.\\n“Okay, five dollars an hour.”\\nSuddenly I was silent. Something had changed. The offer was too\\nbig and ridiculous. Not many grown-ups in 1956 made more than\\nthat, but quickly my temptation disappeared, and calm set in. Slowly,\\nI turned to my left to look at Mike. He looked back at me. The part\\nof my soul that was weak and needy was silenced. The part of me that\\nhad no price took over. I knew Mike\\nPeople’s lives are had gotten to that point too.\\nforever controlled “Good,” rich dad said softly. “Most\\nby two emotions: people have a price. And they have a\\nfear and greed. price because of human emotions named\\nfear and greed. First, the fear of being\\nwithout money motivates us to work hard, and then once we get that\\npaycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the wonderful\\nthings money can buy. The pattern is then set.”\\n“What pattern?” I asked.\\n“The pattern of get up, go to work, pay bills; get up, go to work,\\npay bills. People’s lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear\\nand greed. Offer them more money and they continue the cycle by\\nincreasing their spending. This is what I call the Rat Race.”\\n“There is another way?” Mike asked.\\n“Yes,” said rich dad slowly. “But only a few people find it.”\\n“And what is that way?” Mike asked.\\n“That’s what I hope you boys will learn as you work and study\\nwith me. That is why I took away all forms of pay.”\\n“Any hints?” Mike asked. “We’re kind of tired of working hard,\\nespecially for nothing.”\\n“Well, the first step is telling the truth,” said rich dad.\\n“We haven’t been lying,” I said.\\n29', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter One: Lesson 1\\n“I did not say you were lying. I said to tell the truth,” rich\\ndad retorted.\\n“The truth about what?” I asked.\\n“How you’re feeling,” rich dad said. “You don’t have to say it\\nto anyone else. Just admit it to yourself.”\\n“You mean the people in this park, the people who work for you,\\nMrs. Martin, they don’t do that?” I asked.\\n“I doubt it,” said rich dad. “Instead, they feel the fear of not\\nhaving money. They don’t confront it logically. They react emotionally\\ninstead of using their heads,” rich dad said. “Then, they get a few\\nbucks in their hands and again, the emotions of joy, desire, and greed\\ntake over. And again they react, instead of think.”\\n“So their emotions control their brain,” Mike said.\\n“That’s correct,” said rich dad. “Instead of admitting the truth\\nabout how they feel, they react to their feelings and fail to think.\\nThey feel the fear so they go to work, hoping that money will soothe\\nthe fear, but it doesn’t.

So they get up and go to work, hoping that a\\npaycheck will kill that fear gnawing at their soul. Money is running\\ntheir lives, and they refuse to tell the truth about that. Money is in\\ncontrol of their emotions and their souls.”\\nRich dad sat quietly, letting his words sink in. Mike and I heard\\nwhat he said but didn’t understand fully what he was talking about.\\nI just knew that I often wondered why grown-ups hurried off to\\nwork. It did not seem like much fun, and they never looked that\\nhappy, but something kept them going.\\nRealizing we had absorbed as much as possible of what he was\\ntalking about, rich dad said, “I want you boys to avoid that trap.\\nThat is really what I want to teach you. Not just to be rich, because\\nbeing rich does not solve the problem.”\\n30', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\n“It doesn’t?” I asked, surprised.\\n“No, it doesn’t. Let me explain the other emotion: desire. Some\\ncall it greed, but I prefer desire. It’s perfectly normal to desire something\\nbetter, prettier, more fun, or exciting. So people also work for money\\nbecause of desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can buy.\\nBut the joy that money brings is often short-lived, and they soon need\\nmore money for more joy, more pleasure, more comfort, and more\\nsecurity. So they keep working, thinking money will soothe their souls\\nthat are troubled by fear and desire. But money can’t do that.”\\n“Even rich people do this?” Mike asked.\\n“Rich people included,” said rich dad. “In fact, the reason many rich\\npeople are rich isn’t because of desire, but because of fear. They believe\\nthat money can eliminate the fear of being poor, so they amass tons of it,\\nonly to find the fear gets worse. Now they fear losing the money. I have\\nfriends who keep working even though they have plenty. I know people\\nwho have millions who are more afraid now than when they were poor.\\nThey’re terrified of losing it all. The fears that drove them to get rich\\ngot worse. That weak and needy part of their soul is actually screaming\\nlouder. They don’t want to lose the big houses, the cars and the high life\\nmoney has bought them. They worry about what their friends would say\\nif they lost all their money. Many are emotionally desperate and neurotic,\\nalthough they look rich and have more money.”\\n“So is a poor man happier?” I asked.\\n“No, I don’t think so,” replied rich dad. “The avoidance of money\\nis just as psychotic as being attached to money.”\\nAs if on cue, the town derelict went past our table, stopping by\\nthe large rubbish can and rummaging around in it. The three of us\\nwatched him with great interest, when before we probably would\\nhave just ignored him.\\nRich dad pulled a dollar out of his wallet and gestured to the\\nolder man. Seeing the money, the derelict came over immediately,\\ntook the bill, thanked rich dad profusely, and hurried off, ecstatic\\nwith his good fortune.\\n“He’s not much different from most of my employees,” said rich\\ndad. “I’ve met so many people who say, ‘Oh, I’m not interested in\\n31', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter One: Lesson 1\\nmoney.’ Yet they’ll work at a job for eight hours a day. That’s a denial of\\ntruth. If they weren’t interested in money, then why are they working?\\nThat kind of thinking is probably more psychotic than a person who\\nhoards money.”\\nAs I sat there listening to my rich dad, my mind flashed back to\\nthe countless times my own dad said, “I’m not interested in money.”\\nHe said those words often. He also\\nSo many people say, covered himself by always saying,\\n“Oh, I’m not “I work because I love my job.”\\ninterested in money.” “So what do we do?” I asked. “Not\\nYet they’ll work work for money until all traces of fear\\nat a job for and greed are gone?”\\neight hours a day. “No, that would be a waste of time,”\\nsaid rich dad. “Emotions are what make\\nus human. The word ‘emotion’ stands for ‘energy in motion.’ Be\\ntruthful about your emotions and use your mind and emotions in\\nyour favor, not against yourself.”\\n“Whoa!” said Mike.\\n“Don’t worry about what I just said. It will make more sense in\\nyears to come. Just be an observer, not a reactor, to your emotions.\\nMost people do not know that it’s their emotions that are doing the\\nthinking. Your emotions are your emotions, but you have got to learn\\nto do your own thinking.”\\n“Can you give me an example?” I asked.\\n“Sure,” replied rich dad. “When a person says, ‘I need to find\\na job,’ it’s most likely an emotion doing the thinking. Fear of not\\nhaving money generates that thought.”\\n“But people do need money if they have bills to pay,” I said.\\n“Sure they do,” smiled rich dad. “All I’m saying is that it’s fear that\\nis all too often doing the thinking.”\\n“I don’t understand,” said Mike.\\n“For example,” said rich dad. “If the fear of not having enough\\nmoney arises, instead of immediately running out to get a job, they\\ninstead might ask themselves this question: ‘Will a job be the best\\n32', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nsolution to this fear over the long run?’ In my opinion, the answer is\\nno. A job is really a short-term solution to a long-term problem.”\\n“But my dad is always saying, ‘Stay in school and get good grades,\\nso you can find a safe, secure job,’” I interjected, somewhat confused.\\n“Yes, I understand he says that,” said rich dad, smiling. “Most people\\nrecommend that, and it’s a good path for most people. But people make\\nthat recommendation primarily out of fear.”\\n“You mean my dad says that because he’s afraid?”\\n“Yes,” said rich dad. “He’s terrified that you won’t earn enough\\nmoney and won’t fit into society. Don’t get me wrong. He loves you\\nand wants the best for you. I too believe an education and a job are\\nimportant, but it won’t handle the fear. You see, that same fear that\\nmakes him get up in the morning to earn a few bucks is the fear that\\nis causing him to be so fanatical about your going to school.”\\n“So what do you recommend?” I asked.\\n“I want to teach you to master the power of money, instead of\\nbeing afraid of it. They don’t teach that in school and, if you don’t\\nlearn it, you become a slave to money.”\\nIt was finally making sense. He wanted us to widen our views\\nand to see what the Mrs. Martins of this world couldn’t see. He used\\nexamples that sounded cruel at the time, but I’ve never forgotten\\nthem. My vision widened that day, and I began to see the trap that\\nlay ahead for most people.\\n“You see, we’re all employees ultimately. We just work at different\\nlevels,” said rich dad. “I just want you boys to have a chance to avoid\\nthe trap caused by those two emotions, fear and desire. Use them in\\nyour favor, not against you. That’s what I want to teach you. I’m not\\ninterested in just teaching you to make a pile of money. That won’t\\nhandle the fear or desire. If you don’t first handle fear and desire, and\\nyou get rich, you’ll only be a highly paid slave.”\\n“So how do we avoid the trap?” I asked.\\n“The main cause of poverty or financial struggle is fear and\\nignorance, not the economy or the government or the rich. It’s\\nself-inflicted fear and ignorance that keep people trapped. So you\\n33', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter One: Lesson 1\\nboys go to school and get your college degrees, and I’ll teach you\\nhow to stay out of the trap.”\\nThe pieces of the puzzle were appearing. My highly educated dad\\nhad a great education and a great career, but school never told him\\nhow to handle money or his fear of it. It became clear that I could\\nlearn different and important things from two fathers.\\n“So you’ve been talking about the fear of not having money. How\\ndoes the desire for money affect our thinking?” Mike asked.\\n“How did you feel when I tempted you with a pay raise? Did you\\nnotice your desires rising?”\\nWe nodded our heads.\\n“By not giving in to your emotions, you were able to delay\\nyour reactions and think. That is important. We will always have\\nemotions of fear and greed. From here on in, it’s imperative for you\\nto use those emotions to your advantage, and for the long term to not\\nlet your emotions control your thinking. Most people use fear and\\ngreed against themselves. That’s the start of ignorance. Most people\\nlive their lives chasing paychecks, pay raises and job security because\\nof the emotions of desire and fear, not really questioning where those\\nemotion-driven thoughts are leading them. It’s just like the picture of\\na donkey dragging a cart with its owner dangling a carrot just in front\\nof its nose. The donkey’s owner may be going where he wants to, but\\nthe donkey is chasing an illusion. Tomorrow there will only be another\\ncarrot for the donkey.”\\n“You mean the moment I picture a new baseball glove, candy and\\ntoys, that’s like a carrot to a donkey?” Mike asked.\\n“Yes, and as you get older, your toys get more expensive—a new\\ncar, a boat, and a big house to impress your friends,” said rich dad\\nwith a smile. “Fear pushes you out the door, and desire calls to you.\\nThat’s the trap.”\\n“So what’s the answer,” Mike asked.\\n“What intensifies fear and desire is ignorance. That is why rich\\npeople with lots of money often have more fear the richer they get.\\nMoney is the carrot, the illusion. If the donkey could see the whole\\npicture, it might rethink its choice to chase the carrot.”\\n34', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nRich dad went on to explain that a human’s life is a struggle\\nbetween ignorance and illumination.\\nHe explained that once a person stops searching for information\\nand self-knowledge, ignorance sets in. That struggle is a moment-to-\\nmoment decision—to learn to open or close one’s mind.\\n“Look, school is very important. You go to school to learn a skill\\nor profession to become a contributing member of society. Every\\nculture needs teachers, doctors, mechanics, artists, cooks, businesspeople,\\npolice officers, firefighters, and soldiers. Schools train them so society\\ncan thrive and flourish,” said rich dad. “Unfortunately, for many people\\nschool is the end, not the beginning.”\\nThere was a long silence. Rich dad was smiling. I didn’t\\ncomprehend everything he said that day. But as with most great\\nteachers, his words continued to teach for years.\\n“I’ve been a little cruel today,” said rich dad. “But I want you\\nto always remember this talk. I want you to always think of Mrs.\\nMartin. And I want you always to remember that donkey. Never\\nforget that fear and desire can lead you into life’s biggest trap if you’re\\nnot aware of them controlling your thinking. To spend your life\\nliving in fear, never exploring your dreams, is cruel. To work hard for\\nmoney, thinking that it will buy you things that will make you happy\\nis also cruel. To wake up in the middle of the night terrified about\\npaying bills is a horrible way to live. To live a life dictated by the size\\nof a paycheck is not really living a life. Thinking that a job makes you\\nsecure is lying to yourself. That’s cruel, and that’s the trap I want\\nyou to avoid. I’ve seen how money runs people’s lives. Don’t let that\\nhappen to you. Please don’t let money run your life.”\\nA softball rolled under our table. Rich dad picked it up and threw\\nit back.\\n“So what does ignorance have to do with greed and fear?” I asked.\\n“Because it is ignorance about money that causes so much greed\\nand fear,” said rich dad. “Let me give you some examples. A doctor,\\nwanting more money to better provide for his family, raises his fees.\\nBy raising his fees, it makes health care more expensive for everyone.\\n35', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter One: Lesson 1\\nIt hurts the poor people the most, so they have worse health than\\nthose with money. Because the doctors raise their fees, the attorneys\\nraise their fees. Because the attorneys’ fees have gone up, schoolteachers\\nwant a raise, which raises our taxes, and on and on and on. Soon there\\nwill be such a horrifying gap between the rich and the poor that chaos\\nwill break out and another great civilization will collapse. History\\nproves that great civilizations collapse when the gap between the haves\\nand have-nots is too great. Sadly, America is on that same course\\nbecause we haven’t learned from history. We only memorize historical\\ndates and names, not the lesson.”\\n“Aren’t prices supposed to go up?” I asked.\\n“In an educated society with a well-run government, prices should\\nactually come down. Of course, that is often only true in theory.\\nPrices go up because of greed and fear caused by ignorance. If schools\\ntaught people about money, there would be more money and lower\\nprices. But schools focus only on teaching people to work for money,\\nnot how to harness money’s power.”\\n“But don’t we have business schools?” Mike asked. “And haven’t\\nyou encouraged me to go for my MBA?”\\n“Yes,” said rich dad. “But all too often business schools train\\nemployees to become sophisticated bean-counters. Heaven forbid a bean-\\ncounter takes over a business. All they do is look at the numbers, fire\\npeople, and kill the business. I know this because I hire bean-counters.\\nAll they think about is cutting costs and raising prices, which cause more\\nproblems. Bean-counting is important. I wish more people knew it, but\\nit, too, is not the whole picture,” added rich dad angrily.\\n“So is there an answer?” asked Mike.\\n“Yes,” said rich dad. “Learn to use your emotions to think, not\\nthink with your emotions. When you boys mastered your emotions\\nby agreeing to work for free, I knew there was hope. When you again\\nresisted your emotions when I tempted you with more money, you\\nwere again learning to think in spite of being emotionally charged.\\nThat’s the first step.”\\n“Why is that step so important?” I asked.\\n36', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\n“Well, that’s up to you to find out. If you want to learn, I’ll take\\nyou boys into the briar patch, a place almost everyone else avoids. If\\nyou go with me, you’ll let go of the idea of working for money and\\ninstead learn to have money work for you.”\\n“And what will we get if we go with you. What if we agree to\\nlearn from you? What will we get?” I asked.\\n“The same thing Brer Rabbit got,” said rich dad, referring to the\\nclassic children’s story.\\n“Is there a briar patch?” I asked.\\n“Yes,” said rich dad. “The briar patch is our fear and greed.\\nConfronting fear, weaknesses, and neediness by choosing our own\\nthoughts is the way out.”\\n“Choosing our thoughts?” Mike asked, puzzled.\\n“Yes. Choosing what we think rather than reacting to our emotions.\\nInstead of just getting up and going to work because not having the\\nmoney to pay your bills is scaring you, ask yourself, ‘Is working harder\\nat this the best solution to this problem?’ Most people are too afraid to\\nrationally think things through and instead run out the door to a job\\nthey hate. The Tar Baby is in control. That’s what I mean by choosing\\nyour thoughts.”\\n“And how do we do that?” Mike asked.\\n“That’s what I will teach you. I’ll teach you to have a choice of\\nthoughts rather than a knee-jerk reaction, like gulping down your\\nmorning coffee and running out the door.\\n“Remember what I said before: A job is only a short-term\\nsolution to a long-term problem. Most people have only one problem\\nin mind, and it’s short-term. It’s the bills at the end of the month,\\nthe Tar Baby. Money controls their lives, or should I say the fear and\\nignorance about money controls it. So they do as their parents did.\\nThey get up every day and go work for money, not taking the time to\\nask the question, ‘Is there another way?’ Their emotions now control\\ntheir thinking, not their heads.”\\n“Can you tell the difference between emotions thinking and the\\nhead thinking?” Mike asked.\\n37', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter One: Lesson 1\\n“Oh, yes. I hear it all the time,” said rich dad. “I hear things like,\\n‘Well, everyone has to work.’ Or ‘The rich are crooks.’ Or ‘I’ll get\\nanother job. I deserve this raise. You can’t push me around.’ Or ‘I like\\nthis job because it’s secure.’ No one asks, ‘Is there something I’m\\nmissing here?’ which would break through the emotional thought\\nand give you time to think clearly.”\\nAs we headed back to the store, rich dad explained that the rich\\nreally did “make money.” They did not work for it. He went on to\\nexplain that when Mike and I were casting five-cent pieces out of\\nlead, thinking we were making money, we were very close to thinking\\nthe way the rich think. The problem was that creating money is legal\\nfor the government and banks to do, but illegal for us to do. There are\\nlegal ways to create money from nothing, he told us.\\nRich dad went on to explain that the rich know that money is an\\nillusion, truly like the carrot for the donkey. It’s only out of fear and\\ngreed that the illusion of money is held together by billions of people\\nwho believe that money is real. It’s not. Money is really made up. It\\nis only because of the illusion of confidence and the ignorance of the\\nmasses that this house of cards stands.\\nHe talked about the gold standard that America was on, and that\\neach dollar bill was actually a silver certificate. What concerned him\\nwas the rumor that we would someday go off the gold standard and\\nour dollars would no longer be backed by something tangible.\\n“If that happens, boys, all hell will break loose. The poor, the\\nmiddle class, and the ignorant will have their lives ruined simply\\nbecause they will continue to believe that money is real and that the\\ncompany they work for, or the government, will look after them.”\\nWe really did not understand what he was saying that day, but\\nover the years, it made more and more sense.\\nSeeing What Others Miss\\nAs he climbed into his pickup truck outside his convenience store,\\nrich dad said, “Keep working boys, but the sooner you forget about\\nneeding a paycheck, the easier your adult life will be. Keep using your\\n38', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nbrain, work for free, and soon your mind will show you ways of\\nmaking money far beyond what I could ever pay you. You will see\\nthings that other people never see. Most people never see these\\nopportunities because they’re looking for money and security, so that’s\\nall they get. The moment you see one opportunity, you’ll see them\\nfor the rest of your life. The moment you do that, I’ll teach you\\nsomething else. Learn this, and you’ll avoid one of life’s biggest traps.\\nMike and I picked up our things from the store and waved\\ngoodbye to Mrs. Martin. We went back to the park, to the same\\npicnic bench, and spent several more hours thinking and talking.\\nWe spent the next week at school thinking and talking, too. For\\ntwo more weeks, we kept thinking, talking, and working for free.\\nAt the end of the second Saturday, I was again saying goodbye\\nto Mrs. Martin and looking at the comic-book stand with a longing\\ngaze. The hard thing about not even getting 30 cents every Saturday\\nwas that I didn’t have any money to buy comic books. Suddenly, as\\nMrs. Martin said goodbye to Mike and me, I saw her do something I’d\\nnever seen her do before.\\nMrs. Martin was cutting the front page of the comic book in half.\\nShe kept the top half of the comic book cover and threw the rest of the\\nbook into a large cardboard box. When I asked her what she did with\\nthe comic books, she said, “I throw them away. I give the top half of\\nthe cover back to the comic-book distributor for credit when he brings\\nin the new comics. He’s coming in an hour.”\\nMike and I waited for an hour. Soon the distributor arrived, and\\nI asked him if we could have the comic books. To my delight, he said,\\n“You can have them if you work for this store and do not resell them.”\\nRemember our old business partnership? Well, Mike and I revived\\nit. Using a spare room in Mike’s basement, we began piling hundreds\\nof comic books in that room. Soon our comic-book library was open\\nto the public. We hired Mike’s younger sister, who loved to study, to be\\nhead librarian. She charged each child 10 cents admission to the library,\\nwhich was open from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. every day after school.\\nThe customers, the children of the neighborhood, could read as many\\n39', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter One: Lesson 1\\ncomics as they wanted in two hours. It was a bargain for them since a\\ncomic cost 10 cents each, and they could read five or six in two hours.\\nMike’s sister would check the kids as they left to make sure they\\nweren’t borrowing any comic books. She also kept the books, logging\\nin how many kids showed up each day, who they were, and any\\ncomments they might have. Mike and I averaged $9.50 per week\\nover a three-month period. We paid his sister one dollar a week and\\nallowed her to read the comics for free, which she rarely did since she\\nwas always studying.\\nMike and I kept our agreement by working in the store every\\nSaturday and collecting all the comic books from the different stores.\\nWe kept our agreement to the distributor by not selling any comic\\nbooks. We burned them once they got too tattered. We tried opening\\na branch office, but we could never quite find someone as trustworthy\\nand dedicated as Mike’s sister. At an early age, we found out how hard\\nit was to find good staff.\\nThree months after the library first opened, a fight broke out in\\nthe room. Some bullies from another neighborhood pushed their\\nway in, and Mike’s dad suggested we shut down the business. So\\nour comic-book business shut down, and we stopped working on\\nSaturdays at the convenience store. But rich dad was excited because\\nhe had new things he wanted to teach us. He was happy because we\\nhad learned our first lesson so well: We learned to make money work\\nfor us. By not getting paid for our work at the store, we were forced\\nto use our imaginations to identify an opportunity to make money.\\nBy starting our own business, the comic-book library, we were in\\ncontrol of our own finances, not dependent on an employer. The best\\npart was that our business generated money for us, even when we\\nweren’t physically there. Our money worked for us.\\nInstead of paying us money, rich dad had given us so much more.\\n40', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Two\\nLESSON 2: WHY TEACH\\nFINANCIAL LITERACY?\\nIt’s not how much money you make.\\nIt’s how much money you keep.\\nIn 1990, Mike took over his father’s empire and is, in fact,\\ndoing a better job than his dad did.

Among\\nthem were Charles Schwab, head of the largest independent steel\\ncompany; Samuel Insull, president of the world’s largest utility;\\nHoward Hopson, head of the largest gas company; Ivar Kreuger,\\npresident of International Match Co., one of the world’s largest\\ncompanies at that time; Leon Frazier, president of the Bank of\\nInternational Settlements; Richard Whitney, president of the\\nNew York Stock Exchange; Arthur Cotton and Jesse Livermore,\\ntwo of the biggest stock speculators; and Albert Fall, a member of\\nPresident Harding’s cabinet. Twenty-five years later, nine of these\\ntitans ended their lives as follows: Schwab died penniless after\\nliving for five years on borrowed money. Insull died broke in a\\nforeign land, and Kreuger and Cotton also died broke. Hopson\\nwent insane. Whitney and Albert Fall were released from prison,\\nand Fraser and Livermore committed suicide.\\nI doubt if anyone can say what really happened to these men.\\nIf you look at the date, 1923, it was just before the 1929 market crash\\nand the Great Depression, which I suspect had a great impact on\\nthese men and their lives. The point is this: Today we live in times of\\ngreater and faster change than these men did. I suspect there will be\\nmany booms and busts in the coming years that will parallel the ups\\nand downs these men faced. I am concerned that too many people\\nare too focused on money and not on their greatest wealth, their\\neducation.

Increased\\nspending throws families into greater debt and into more financial\\nuncertainty, even though they may be advancing in their jobs and\\nreceiving raises on a regular basis. This is high-risk living caused by\\nweak financial education.\\nThe massive loss of jobs in recent times proves how shaky the\\nmiddle class really is financially. Company pension plans are being\\nreplaced by 401(k) plans. Social Security is obviously in trouble and\\ncan’t be relied upon as a source for retirement. Panic has set in for\\nthe middle class.\\nToday, mutual funds are popular because they supposedly\\nrepresent safety. Average mutual-fund buyers are too busy working to\\npay taxes and mortgages, save for their children’s college, and pay off\\ncredit cards. They do not have time to study investing, so they rely\\non the expertise of the manager of a mutual fund. Also, because the\\nmutual fund includes many different types of investments, they feel\\ntheir money is safer because it is “diversified.” This educated middle\\nclass subscribes to the dogma put out by mutual-fund brokers and\\nfinancial planners: “Play it safe. Avoid risk.”\\nThe real tragedy is that the lack of early financial education is what\\ncreates the risk faced by average middle-class people. The reason they have\\nto play it safe is because their financial positions are tenuous at best. Their\\nbalance sheets are not balanced. Instead, they are loaded with liabilities\\nand have no real assets that generate income. Typically, their only source\\nof income is their paycheck. Their livelihood becomes entirely dependent\\non their employer. So when genuine “deals of a lifetime” come along,\\nthese people can’t take advantage of them because they are working so\\nhard, are taxed to the max, and are loaded with debt.\\nAs I said at the start of this section, the most important rule\\nis to know the difference between an asset and a liability.

I could now measure and know where I\\nwas in terms of my goal to become financially independent.\\nAlthough net worth often includes non-cash-producing assets, like\\nstuff you bought that now sits in your garage, wealth measures how\\nmuch money your money is making and, therefore, your financial\\nsurvivability.\\nWealth is the measure of the cash flow from the asset column\\ncompared with the expense column.\\nLet’s use an example. Let’s say I have cash flow from my asset\\ncolumn of $1,000 a month. And I have monthly expenses of $2,000.\\nWhat is my wealth?\\nLet’s go back to Buckminster Fuller’s definition. Using his\\ndefinition, how many days forward can I survive? Assuming a 30-day\\nmonth, I have enough cash flow for half a month.\\nWhen I achieve $2,000 a month cash flow from my assets, then\\nI will be wealthy.\\nSo while I’m not yet rich, I am wealthy. I now have income\\ngenerated from assets each month that fully cover my monthly\\nexpenses. If I want to increase my expenses, I first must increase my\\ncash flow to maintain this level of wealth. Also note that it is at this\\npoint that I’m no longer dependent on my wages. I have focused on,\\nand been successful in, building an asset column that has made me\\nfinancially independent. If I quit my job today, I would be able to\\ncover my monthly expenses with the cash flow from my assets.\\nMy next goal would be to have the excess cash flow from my\\nassets reinvested into the asset column.

The more\\n69', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Two: Lesson 2\\nmy assets grow, the more my cash flow grows. And as long as I keep my\\nexpenses less than the cash flow from these assets, I grow richer with\\nmore and more income from sources other than my physical labor.\\nAs this reinvestment process continues, I am well on my way to\\nbecoming rich.

An\\nimportant distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while the\\npoor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first.

My teacher thought it was a wonderful story of a\\nromantic hero who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. My rich\\ndad did not see Robin Hood as a hero. He called Robin Hood a crook.\\nRobin Hood may be long gone, but his followers live on. I often\\nstill hear people say, “Why don’t the rich pay for it?” or “The rich\\nshould pay more in taxes and give it to the poor.”\\nIt is this Robin Hood fantasy, or taking from the rich to give to\\nthe poor, that has caused the most pain for the poor and the middle\\nclass. The reason the middle class is so heavily taxed is because of the\\nRobin Hood ideal. The reality is that the rich are not taxed. It’s the\\nmiddle class, especially the educated upper-income middle class, who\\npays for the poor.\\nAgain, to understand fully how things happen, we need to look\\nat the history of taxes. Although my highly educated dad was an\\nexpert on the history of education, my rich dad fashioned himself as\\nan expert on the history of taxes.\\n79', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Four: Lesson 4\\nRich dad explained to Mike and me that originally, in England\\nand America, there were no taxes. Occasionally, there were temporary\\ntaxes levied in order to pay for wars. The king or the president would\\nput the word out and ask everyone to “chip in.” Taxes were levied in\\nBritain for the fight against Napoleon from 1799 to 1816, and in\\nAmerica to pay for the Civil War from 1861 to 1865.\\nIn 1874, England made income tax a permanent levy on its citizens.\\nIn 1913, an income tax became permanent in the United States with\\nthe adoption of the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. At one\\ntime, Americans were anti-tax. It had been the tax on tea that led to the\\nfamous Tea Party in Boston Harbor, an incident that helped ignite the\\nRevolutionary War. It took approximately 50 years in both England and\\nthe United States to sell the idea of a regular income tax.\\nWhat these historical dates fail to reveal is that both of these taxes\\nwere initially levied against only the rich. It was this point that rich dad\\nwanted Mike and me to understand. He explained that the idea of taxes\\nwas made popular, and accepted by the majority, by telling the poor and\\nthe middle class that taxes were created only to punish the rich. This is\\nhow the masses voted for the law, and it became constitutionally legal.\\nAlthough it was intended to punish the rich, in reality it wound up\\npunishing the very people who voted for it, the poor and middle class.\\n“Once government got a taste of money, its appetite grew,” said rich\\ndad. “Your dad and I are exactly opposite. He’s a government bureaucrat,\\nand I am a capitalist. We get paid, and our success is measured on\\nopposite behaviors. He gets paid to spend money and hire people. The\\nmore he spends and the more people he hires, the larger his organization\\nbecomes. In the government, a large organization is a respected\\norganization. On the other hand, within my organization, the fewer\\npeople I hire and the less money I spend, the more I am respected by my\\ninvestors. That’s why I don’t like government people. They have different\\nobjectives than most business people. As the government grows, more\\nand more tax dollars are needed to support it.”\\nMy educated dad sincerely believed that government should help\\npeople. He loved John F.

As I said, the passage of taxes was only possible because the\\nmasses believed in the Robin Hood theory of economics: Take from the\\nrich, and give to everyone else. The problem was that the government’s\\nappetite for money was so great that taxes soon needed to be levied on\\nthe middle class, and from there it kept trickling down.\\nHowever, the rich saw an opportunity because they don’t play by\\nthe same set of rules. The rich knew about corporations, which became\\npopular in the days of sailing ships. The rich created the corporation\\nas a vehicle to limit their risk to the assets of each voyage. The rich put\\ntheir money into a corporation to finance the voyage. The corporation\\nwould then hire a crew to sail to the New World to look for treasure. If\\nthe ship was lost, the crew lost their lives, but the loss to the rich would\\nbe limited only to the money they invested for that particular voyage.\\n81', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Four: Lesson 4\\nThe diagram that follows shows how the corporate structure sits\\noutside your personal income statement and balance sheet.\\nCORPORATION\\nINCOME STATEMENT\\nIncome\\nPERSONAL\\nINCOME STATEMENT\\nExpenses Income\\nExpenses\\nPERSONAL BALANCE SHEET\\nAssets Liabilities\\n82', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nIt is the knowledge of the legal corporate structure that really gives\\nthe rich a vast advantage over the poor and the middle class. Having two\\nfathers teaching me, one a socialist and the other a capitalist, I quickly\\nbegan to realize that the philosophy of the capitalist made more financial\\nsense to me. It seemed to me that the socialists ultimately penalized\\nthemselves due to their lack of financial education. No matter what the\\n“take-from-the-rich” crowd came up with, the rich always found a way to\\noutsmart them. That is how taxes were eventually levied on the middle\\nclass. The rich outsmarted the intellectuals solely because they understood\\nthe power of money, a subject not taught in schools.\\nHow did the rich outsmart the intellectuals? Once the “take-from-\\nthe-rich” tax was passed, cash started flowing into government coffers.\\nInitially, people were happy. Money was handed out to government\\nworkers and the rich. It went to government workers in the form of\\njobs and pensions, and it went to the rich via their factories receiving\\ngovernment contracts. The government received a large pool of money,\\nbut the problem was the fiscal management of that money. The\\ngovernment ideal is to avoid having excess money. If you fail to spend\\nyour allotted funds, you risk losing it in the next budget. You would\\ncertainly not be recognized for being efficient.

In my opinion, that is simply too\\nlong. The harder you work, the more you pay the government. That is\\nwhy I believe that the idea of “take-from-the-rich” backfired on the very\\npeople who voted it in.\\nEvery time people try to punish the rich, the rich don’t simply\\ncomply. They react.

They use their resources to effect change.\\nThe Tax Code of the United States also allows other ways to reduce\\ntaxes. Most of these vehicles are available to anyone, but it is the rich\\nwho find them because they are minding their own business. For\\nexample, “1031” is jargon for Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue\\nCode which allows a seller to delay paying taxes on a piece of real estate\\nthat is sold for a capital gain through an exchange for a more expensive\\npiece of real estate. Real estate is one investment vehicle that has a great\\ntax advantage. As long as you keep trading up in value, you will not be\\ntaxed on the gains until you liquidate.

The difference is profound when it comes\\nto long-term wealth.\\n• Tax advantages\\nA corporation can do many things that an employee cannot,\\nlike pay expenses before paying taxes. That is a whole area of\\nexpertise that is very exciting. Employees earn and get taxed,\\nand they try to live on what is left. A corporation earns,\\nspends everything it can, and is taxed on anything that is\\nleft. It’s one of the biggest legal tax loopholes that the rich\\nuse.

Everybody wants a piece of\\nyour action. The rich hide much of their wealth using\\nvehicles such as corporations and trusts to protect their\\nassets from creditors. When someone sues a wealthy\\nindividual, they are often met with layers of legal protection\\nand often find that the wealthy person actually owns\\nnothing. They control everything, but own nothing. The\\npoor and middle class try to own everything and lose it to\\nthe government or to fellow citizens who like to sue the\\nrich.

A multi-billion-\\ndollar industry emerged, and AT&T was born.\\nThe evening news came on right after the story of Alexander\\nGraham Bell. On the news was a story of another downsizing at a\\nlocal company. The workers were angry and complained that the\\ncompany ownership was unfair. A terminated manager of about\\n45 years of age had his wife and two babies at the plant and was\\nbegging the guards to let him talk to the owners to ask if they would\\nreconsider his termination.

We all have tremendous potential, and\\nwe all are blessed with gifts. Yet the one thing that holds all of us back\\nis some degree of self-doubt. It is not so much the lack of technical\\ninformation that holds us back, but more the lack of self-confidence.\\nSome are more affected than others.\\nOnce we leave school, most of us know that it is not so much a\\nmatter of college degrees or good grades that count. In the real world\\noutside of academics, something more than just grades is required.\\nI have heard it called many things; guts, chutzpah, balls, audacity,\\nbravado, cunning, daring, tenacity, and brilliance. This factor,\\nwhatever it is labeled, ultimately decides one’s future much more\\nthan school grades do.\\nInside each of us is one of these brave, brilliant, and daring\\ncharacters. There is also the flip side of that character: people who\\ncould get down on their knees and beg if necessary. After a year in\\nVietnam as a Marine Corps pilot, I got to know both of those\\ncharacters inside of me intimately. One is not better than the other.\\nYet as a teacher, I recognized that it was excessive fear and\\nself-doubt that were the greatest detractors of personal genius. It\\nbroke my heart to see students know the answers, yet lack the courage\\nto act on the answer. Often in the real world, it’s not the smart who\\nget ahead, but the bold.\\nIn my personal experience, your financial genius requires both\\ntechnical knowledge as well as courage. If fear is too strong, the\\ngenius is suppressed. In my classes, I strongly urge students to learn\\nto take risks, to be bold, and to let their genius convert that fear into\\npower and brilliance. It works for some and just terrifies others. I have\\ncome to realize that for most people, when it comes to the subject of\\nmoney, they would rather play it safe.

It was full of turmoil, and it was exciting.\\nSo why bother developing your financial IQ? Because if you do,\\nyou will prosper greatly.

In the early\\n1990s, the economy of Phoenix, Arizona, was horrible. I was watching a\\nTV show when a financial planner came on and began forecasting doom\\nand gloom. His advice was to save money. “Put $100 away every month,”\\nhe said. “In 40 years you will be a multimillionaire.”\\nWell, putting money away every month is a sound idea. It is one\\noption—the option most people subscribe to. The problem is this: It\\nblinds the person to what is really going on. It causes them to miss major\\nopportunities for much more significant growth of their money. The\\nworld is passing them by.\\nAs I said, the economy was terrible at that time. For investors,\\nthis is the perfect market condition. A chunk of my money was\\nin the stock market and in apartment houses. I was short of cash.\\nBecause people were giving properties away, I was buying. I was not\\nsaving money. I was investing. Kim and I had more than a million\\ndollars in cash working in a market that was rising fast. It was the best\\nopportunity to invest. The economy was terrible. I just could not pass\\nup these small deals.\\nHouses that were once $100,000 were now $75,000. But instead\\nof shopping with local real estate agents, I began shopping at the\\nbankruptcy attorney’s office, or the courthouse steps. In these\\nshopping places, a $75,000 house could sometimes be bought for\\n$20,000 or less. For $2,000, which was loaned to me from a friend\\nfor 90 days for $200, I gave an attorney a cashier’s check as a down\\npayment. While the acquisition was being processed, I ran an ad\\nadvertising a $75,000 house for only $60,000 and no money down.\\n99', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Five: Lesson 5\\nThe phone rang hard and heavy.

The first and most common type is a person who buys a\\npackaged investment. They call a retail outlet, such as a real\\nestate company, a stockbroker, or a financial planner, and they\\nbuy something. It could be a mutual fund, a REIT, a stock or\\na bond. It is a clean and simple way of investing. An analogy\\nwould be a shopper who goes to a computer store and buys a\\ncomputer right off the shelf.\\n2. The second type is an investor who creates investments.\\nThis investor usually assembles a deal in the same way a\\nperson who buys components builds a computer. I do not\\nknow the first thing about putting components of a computer\\ntogether, but I do know how to put pieces of opportunities\\ntogether, or know people who know how.\\nIt is this second type of investor who is the more professional\\ninvestor. Sometimes it may take years for all the pieces to come\\ntogether. And sometimes they never do. It’s this second type of investor\\nthat my rich dad encouraged me to be. It is important to learn how to\\nput the pieces together, because that is where the huge wins reside, and\\nsometimes some huge losses if the tide goes against you.\\nIf you want to be the second type of investor, you need to develop\\nthree main skills.\\n111', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Five: Lesson 5\\n1. Find an opportunity that everyone else missed.\\nYou see with your mind what others miss with their eyes.\\nFor example, a friend bought this rundown old house. It was\\nspooky to look at. Everyone wondered why he bought it.\\nWhat he saw that we did not was that the house came with\\nfour extra empty lots. He discovered that after going to the\\ntitle company. After buying the house, he tore the house\\ndown and sold the five lots to a builder for three times what\\nhe paid for the entire package. He made $75,000 for two\\nmonths of work. It’s not a lot of money, but it sure beats\\nminimum wage. And it’s not technically difficult.\\n2. Raise money.\\nThe average person only goes to the bank. This second type\\nof investor needs to know how to raise capital, and there are\\nmany ways that don’t require a bank. To get started, I learned\\nhow to buy houses without a bank. It was the learned skill\\nof raising money, more than the houses themselves, that\\nwas priceless.\\nAll too often I hear people say, “The bank won’t lend me\\nmoney,” or “I don’t have the money to buy it.” If you want to\\nbe a type-two investor, you need to learn how to do that which\\nstops most people. In other words, a majority of people let their\\nlack of money stop them from making a deal. If you can avoid\\nthat obstacle, you will be millions ahead of those who don’t\\nlearn those skills. There have been many times I have bought\\na house, a stock, or an apartment building without a penny in\\nthe bank. I once bought an apartment house for $1.2 million.\\nI did what is called “tying it up,” with a written contract\\nbetween seller and buyer.\\nI then raised the $100,000 deposit, which bought me 90 days\\nto raise the rest of the money. Why did I do it? Simply because\\nI knew it was worth $2 million. I never raised the money.\\nInstead,the person who put up the $100,000 gave me $50,000\\n112', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nfor finding the deal, took over my position, and I walked\\naway. Total working time: three days. Again, it’s what you\\nknow more than what you buy. Investing is not buying. It’s\\nmore a case of knowing.\\n3. Organize smart people.\\nIntelligent people are those who work with or hire a\\nperson who is more intelligent than they are. When you\\nneed advice, make sure you choose your advisor wisely.\\nThere is a lot to learn, but the rewards can be astronomical. If you\\ndo not want to learn those skills, then being a type-one investor is highly\\nrecommended. It is what you know that is your greatest wealth. It is what\\nyou do not know that is your greatest risk.\\nThere is always risk, so learn to manage risk instead of avoiding it.\\n113', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='nan', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content=\"Chapter Six\\nLESSON 6: WORK TO LEARN —\\nDON'T WORK FOR MONEY\\nJob security meant everything to my educated dad.\\nLearning meant everything to my rich dad.\\nA few years ago, I granted an interview with a newspaper in\\nSingapore.

It\\nis not a pretty picture for most people working today. And that is just\\nfor retirement. Add medical fees and long-term nursing-home care\\nand the picture is frightening.\\nAlready, many hospitals in countries with socialized medicine\\nneed to make tough decisions such as, “Who will live, and who will\\ndie?” They make those decisions purely on how much money they\\nhave and how old the patients are. If the patient is old, they often will\\ngive the medical care to someone younger. The older poor patient\\ngets put to the back of the line. Just as the rich can afford better\\neducation, the rich will be able to keep themselves alive, while those\\nwho have little wealth will die.\\nSo I wonder: Are workers looking into the future or just until\\ntheir next paycheck, never questioning where they are headed?\\nWhen I speak to adults who want to earn more money, I always\\nrecommend the same thing. I suggest taking a long view of their life.\\nInstead of simply working for the money and security, which I admit\\nare important, I suggest they take a second job that will teach them\\na second skill. Often I recommend joining a network-marketing\\ncompany, also called multilevel marketing, if they want to learn sales\\nskills. Some of these companies have excellent training programs that\\nhelp people get over their fear of failure and rejection, which are the\\nmain reasons people are unsuccessful. Education is more valuable\\nthan money, in the long run.\\nWhen I offer this suggestion, I often hear in response, “Oh that is\\ntoo much hassle,” or “I only want to do what I am interested in.”\\nIf they say, “It’s too much of a hassle,” I ask, “So you would\\nrather work all your life giving 50 percent of what you earn to the\\ngovernment?” If they tell me, “I only do what I am interested in,”\\n122', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nI say, “I’m not interested in going to the gym, but I go because I want\\nto feel better and live longer.”\\nUnfortunately, there is some truth to the old statement, “You can’t\\nteach an old dog new tricks.” Unless a person is used to changing, it’s\\nhard to change.\\nBut for those of you who might be on the fence when it comes\\nto the idea of working to learn something new, I offer this word\\nof encouragement: Life is much like going to the gym. The most\\npainful part is deciding to go. Once you get past that, it’s easy. There\\nhave been many days I have dreaded going to the gym, but once I am\\nthere and in motion, it is a pleasure. After the workout is over, I am\\nalways glad I talked myself into going.\\nIf you are unwilling to work to learn something new and instead\\ninsist on becoming highly specialized within your field, make sure the\\ncompany you work for is unionized. Labor unions are designed to\\nprotect specialists. My educated dad, after falling from grace with\\nthe governor, became the head of the teachers union in Hawaii. He\\ntold me that it was the hardest job he ever held. My rich dad, on the\\nother hand, spent his life doing his best to keep his companies from\\nbecoming unionized. He was successful. Although the unions came\\nclose, rich dad was always able to fight them off.\\nPersonally, I take no sides because I can see the need for and\\nthe benefits of both sides. If you do as school recommends, become\\nhighly specialized. Then seek union protection. For example, had I\\ncontinued with my flying career, I would have sought a company that\\nhad a strong pilots union. Why? Because my life would be dedicated\\nto learning a skill that was valuable in only one industry. If I were\\npushed out of that industry, my life’s skills would not be as valuable\\nto another industry. A displaced senior pilot—with 100,000 hours of\\nheavy airline transport time, earning $150,000 a year—would have a\\nhard time finding an equivalent high-paying job teaching in school.\\nSkills do not necessarily transfer from industry to industry. Skills the\\npilots are paid for in the airline industry are not as important in, say,\\nthe school system.\\n123', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Six: Lesson 6\\nThe same is true even for doctors today. With all the changes in\\nmedicine, many medical specialists are needing to conform to medical\\norganizations such as HMOs. Schoolteachers definitely need to be\\nunion members. Today in America, the teachers union is the largest\\nand the richest labor union of all. The NEA, the National Education\\nAssociation, has tremendous political clout. Teachers need the\\nprotection of their union because their skills are also of limited value\\nto an industry outside of education. So the rule of thumb is: “Highly\\nspecialized; then unionize.” It’s the smart thing to do.\\nWhen I ask the classes I teach, “How many of you can cook a\\nbetter hamburger than McDonald’s?” almost all the students\\nraise their hands. I then ask, “So if most of you can cook a better\\nhamburger, how come McDonald’s makes more money than you?”\\nThe answer is obvious: McDonald’s is excellent at business\\nsystems. The reason so many talented people are poor is because they\\nfocus on building a better hamburger and know little to nothing\\nabout business systems.\\nA friend of mine in Hawaii is a great artist. He makes a sizable\\namount of money. One day his mother’s attorney called to tell him\\nthat she had left him $35,000. That is what was left of her estate after\\nthe attorney and the government took their shares. Immediately, he\\nsaw an opportunity to increase his business by using some of this\\nmoney to advertise. Two months later, his first four-color, full-page\\nad appeared in an expensive magazine that targeted the very rich.\\nThe ad ran for three months. He received no replies from the ad,\\nand all of his inheritance is now gone. He now wants to sue the\\nmagazine for misrepresentation.\\nThis is a common case of someone who can build a beautiful\\nhamburger, but knows little about business. When I asked him what\\nhe learned, his only reply was, “Advertising salespeople are crooks.”\\nI then asked him if he would be willing to take a course in sales and\\na course in direct marketing. His reply, “I don’t have the time, and I\\ndon’t want to waste my money.”\\nThe world is filled with talented poor people. All too often, they’re\\npoor or struggle financially or earn less than they are capable of, not\\n124', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nbecause of what they know, but because of what they do not know.\\nThey focus on perfecting their skills at building a better hamburger\\nrather than the skills of selling and delivering the hamburger. Maybe\\nMcDonald’s does not make the best hamburger, but they are the best\\nat selling and delivering a basic average burger.\\nPoor dad wanted me to specialize. That was his view on how to\\nbe paid more. Even after being told by the governor of Hawaii\\nthat he could no longer work in state government, my educated\\ndad continued to encourage me to get specialized. Educated dad\\nthen took up the cause of the teachers’ union, campaigning for\\nfurther protection and benefits for these highly skilled and educated\\nprofessionals. We argued often, but I know he never agreed that\\noverspecialization is what caused the need for union protection. He\\nnever understood that the more specialized you become, the more\\nyou are trapped and dependent on that specialty.\\nRich dad advised that Mike and I groom ourselves. Many\\ncorporations do the same thing. They find a young bright student\\njust out of business school and begin grooming that person to\\nsomeday take over the company. So these bright young employees\\ndo not specialize in one department. They are moved from\\ndepartment to department to learn all the aspects of business systems.\\nThe rich often groom their children or the children of others. By\\ndoing so, their children gain an overall knowledge of the operations\\nof the business and how the various departments interrelate.\\nFor the World War II generation, it was considered bad to skip\\nfrom company to company. Today, it is considered smart. Since\\npeople will skip from company to company rather than seek greater\\nspecialization in skills, why not seek to learn more than to earn?\\nIn the short term, it may earn you less, but it will pay dividends in\\nthe long term.\\n125', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Six: Lesson 6\\nThe main management skills needed for success are:\\n1. Management of cash flow\\n2. Management of systems\\n3. Management of people\\nThe most important specialized skills are sales and marketing.\\nThe ability to sell—to communicate to another human being, be it\\na customer, employee, boss, spouse, or child—is the base skill of\\npersonal success. Communication skills such as writing, speaking,\\nand negotiating are crucial to a life of success. These are skills I work\\non constantly, attending courses or buying educational resources to\\nexpand my knowledge.\\nAs I have mentioned, my educated dad worked harder and harder\\nthe more competent he became. He also became more trapped the\\nmore specialized he got. Although his salary went up, his choices\\ndiminished. Soon after he was locked out of government work,\\nhe found out how vulnerable he really was professionally. It is like\\nprofessional athletes who suddenly are injured or are too old to play.\\nTheir once high-paying position is gone, and they have limited skills\\nto fall back on. I think that is why my educated dad sided so much\\nwith the unions after that. He realized how much a union would have\\nbenefited him.\\nRich dad encouraged Mike and me to know a little about a lot.\\nHe encouraged us to work with people smarter than we were and to\\nbring smart people together to work as a team. Today it would be\\ncalled a synergy of professional specialities.\\nToday, I meet ex-schoolteachers earning hundreds of thousands\\nof dollars a year. They earn that much because they have specialized\\nskills in their field as well as other skills. They can teach, as well as\\nsell and market. I know of no other skills to be more important than\\nselling and marketing. The skills of selling and marketing are difficult\\nfor most people, primarily due to their fear of rejection. The better\\n126', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nyou are at communicating, negotiating, and handling your fear of\\nrejection, the easier life is. Just as I advised that newspaper writer who\\nwanted to become a best-selling author, I advise anyone else today.\\nBeing technically specialized has its strengths as well as its weaknesses.\\nI have friends who are geniuses, but they cannot communicate effectively\\nwith other human beings and, as a result, their earnings are pitiful.\\nI advise them to just spend a year learning to sell. Even if they earn\\nnothing, their communication skills will improve. And that is priceless.\\nIn addition to being good learners, sellers, and marketers, we\\nneed to be good teachers as well as good students. To be truly rich,\\nwe need to be able to give as well as to receive. In cases of financial\\nor professional struggle, there is often a lack of giving and receiving.\\nI know many people who are poor because they are neither good\\nstudents nor good teachers.\\nBoth of my dads were generous men. Both made it a practice to\\ngive first. Teaching was one of their ways of giving. The more they gave,\\nthe more they received. One glaring difference was in the giving of\\nmoney. My rich dad gave lots of money away. He gave to his church,\\nto charities, and to his foundation. He knew that to receive money,\\nyou had to give money. Giving money is the secret to most great\\nwealthy families. That is why there are organizations like the Rockefeller\\nFoundation and the Ford Foundation. These are organizations designed\\nto take their wealth and increase it, as well as give it away in perpetuity.\\nMy educated dad always said, “When I have some extra money,\\nI’ll give it.” The problem was that there was never any extra. So he\\nworked harder to draw more money in, rather than focus on the most\\nimportant law of money: “Give, and you shall receive.” Instead, he\\nbelieved in: “Receive, and then you give.”\\nIn conclusion, I became both dads. One part of me is a hard-core\\ncapitalist who loves the game of money making money. The other part\\nis a socially responsible teacher who is deeply concerned with this ever-\\nwidening gap between the haves and have-nots.

The primary difference between a rich person\\nand a poor person is how they manage that fear.\\nIt’s okay to be fearful. It’s okay to be a coward when it comes\\nto money. You can still be rich. We’re all heroes at something, and\\ncowards at something else. My friend’s wife is an emergency-room\\nnurse. When she sees blood, she flies into action. When I mention\\ninvesting, she runs away. When I see blood, I don’t run. I pass out.\\nMy rich dad understood phobias about money. “Some people are\\nterrified of snakes. Some people are terrified about losing money. Both\\nare phobias,” he would say. So his solution to the phobia of losing\\nmoney was this little rhyme: “If you hate risk and worry, start early.”\\nIf you start young, it’s easier to be rich. I won’t go into it here,\\nbut there is a staggering difference between a person who starts\\ninvesting at age 20 versus age 30. The purchase of Manhattan Island\\nis said to be one of the greatest bargains of all time. New York was\\npurchased for $24 in trinkets and beads. Yet if that $24 had been\\ninvested at 8 percent annually, that $24 would have been worth more\\nthan $28 trillion by 1995. Manhattan could be repurchased with\\nmoney left over to buy much of Los Angeles.\\nBut what if you don’t have much time left or would like to retire\\nearly? How do you handle the fear of losing money?\\nMy poor dad did nothing. He simply avoided the issue, refusing\\nto discuss the subject.\\nMy rich dad, on the other hand, recommended that I think\\nlike a Texan. “I like Texas and Texans,” he used to say. “In Texas,\\neverything is bigger. When Texans win, they win big. And when\\nthey lose, it’s spectacular.”\\n“They like losing?” I asked.\\n“That’s not what I’m saying. Nobody likes losing. Show me a happy\\nloser, and I’ll show you a loser,” said rich dad. “It’s a Texan’s attitude\\ntoward risk, reward, and failure I’m talking about. It’s how they handle\\nlife. They live it big. Not like most of the people around here, living\\nlike roaches when it comes to money, terrified that someone will shine\\na light on them, and whimpering when the grocery clerk shortchanges\\nthem a quarter.”\\n130', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nRich dad went on. “What I like best is the Texas attitude. They’re\\nproud when they win, and they brag when they lose. Texans have a\\nsaying, ‘If you’re going to go broke, go big.’ You don’t want to admit\\nyou went broke over a duplex.”\\nHe constantly told Mike and me that the greatest reason for lack\\nof financial success was because most people played it too safe. “People\\nare so afraid of losing that they lose” were his words.\\nFran Tarkenton, a one-time great NFL quarterback, says it still\\nanother way: “Winning means being unafraid to lose.”\\nIn my own life, I’ve noticed that winning usually follows losing.\\nBefore I finally learned to ride a bike, I first fell down many times.\\nI’ve never met a golfer who has never lost a golf ball. I’ve never met\\npeople who have fallen in love who have never had their heart broken.\\nAnd I’ve never met someone rich who has never lost money.\\nSo for most people, the reason they don’t win financially is because\\nthe pain of losing money is far greater than the joy of being rich.\\nAnother saying in Texas is, “Everyone wants to go to heaven,\\nbut no one wants to die.” Most people dream of being rich, but are\\nterrified of losing money. So they never\\nFor most people, the\\nget to heaven.\\nreason they don’t win\\nRich dad used to tell Mike and me\\nfinancially is because\\nstories about his trips to Texas. “If you\\nthe pain of losing money really want to learn the attitude of how\\nis far greater than the to handle risk, losing, and failure, go to\\njoy of being rich. San Antonio and visit the Alamo. The\\nAlamo is a great story of brave people\\nwho chose to fight, knowing there was no hope of success. They chose\\nto die instead of surrendering. It’s an inspiring story worthy of study.\\nNonetheless, it’s still a tragic military defeat. They got their butts\\nkicked. So how do Texans handle failure? They still shout, ‘Remember\\nthe Alamo!’”\\nMike and I heard this story a lot. He always told us this story when\\nhe was about to go into a big deal, and he was nervous. After he had\\ndone all his due diligence and it was time to put up or shut up, he told\\nus this story.

It gave him strength, for it reminded him\\nthat he could always turn a financial loss into a financial win. Rich dad\\nknew that failure would only make him stronger and smarter. It’s not\\nthat he wanted to lose. He just knew who he was and how he would\\ntake a loss. He would take a loss and make it a win. That’s what made\\nhim a winner and others losers. It gave him the courage to cross the line\\nwhen others backed out. “That’s why I like Texans so much,” he would\\nsay. “They took a great failure and turned it into inspiration… as well a\\ntourist destination that makes them millions.”\\nBut probably his words that mean the most to me today are these:\\n“Texans don’t bury their failures. They get inspired by them. They take\\ntheir failures and turn them into rallying cries. Failure inspires Texans\\nto become winners. But that formula is not just the formula for Texans.\\nIt is the formula for all winners.”\\nI’ve said that falling off my bike was part of learning to ride.

The greatest\\n132', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nsecret of winners is that failure inspires winning; thus, they’re not\\nafraid of losing. Repeating Fran Tarkenton’s quote, “Winning means\\nbeing unafraid to lose.” People like Fran Tarkenton are not afraid of\\nlosing, because they know who they are. They hate losing, so they\\nknow that losing will only inspire them to become better. There is a\\nbig difference between hating losing and being afraid to lose. Most\\npeople are so afraid of losing money that they lose. They go broke\\nover a duplex. Financially, they play life too safe and too small.\\nThey buy big houses and big cars, but not big investments. The\\nmain reason that over 90 percent of the American public struggles\\nfinancially is because they play not to lose. They don’t play to win.\\nThey go to their financial planners or accountants or stockbrokers\\nand buy a balanced portfolio. Most have lots of cash in CDs, low-yield\\nbonds, mutual funds that can be traded within a mutual-fund family,\\nand a few individual stocks. It is a safe and sensible portfolio. But it is\\nnot a winning portfolio. It is a portfolio of someone playing not to lose.\\nDon’t get me wrong. It’s probably a better portfolio than more\\nthan 70 percent of the population has, and that’s frightening. It’s\\na great portfolio for someone who loves safety. But playing it safe\\nand balanced on your investment portfolio is not the way successful\\ninvestors play the game. If you have little money and you want to\\nbe rich, you must first be focused, not balanced. If you look at any\\nsuccessful person, at the start they were not balanced. Balanced people\\ngo nowhere.

If losing makes you weak, play it\\nsafe. Go with balanced investments. If you’re over 25 years old and are\\nterrified of taking risks, don’t change. Play it safe, but start early. Start\\naccumulating your nest egg early because it will take time.\\nBut if you have dreams of freedom—of getting out of the Rat\\nRace—the first question to ask yourself is, “How do I respond to\\nfailure?” If failure inspires you to win, maybe you should go for it—but\\nonly maybe. If failure makes you weak or causes you to throw temper\\ntantrums—like spoiled brats who call attorneys to file lawsuits every\\ntime something doesn’t go their way—then play it safe. Keep your\\ndaytime job. Or buy bonds or mutual funds. But remember, there is risk\\nin those financial instruments also, even though they may appear safe.\\nI say all this, mentioning Texas and Fran Tarkenton, because\\nstacking the asset column is easy. It’s really a low-aptitude game. It\\ndoesn’t take much education. Fifth-grade math will do. But building\\nyour asset column is a game in which attitude plays a major role.

There’s a\\nChicken Little inside each of us.\\nAs I stated earlier, the cynic is really a little chicken. We all get\\na little chicken when fear and doubt cloud our thoughts.\\nAll of us have doubts: “I’m not smart.” “I’m not good enough.”\\n“So-and-so is better than me.” Our doubts often paralyze us. We\\nplay the “What if?” game. “What if the economy crashes right after\\nI invest?” “What if I lose control and I can’t pay the money back?”\\n“What if things don’t go as I planned?” Or we have friends or loved\\nones who will remind us of our shortcomings. They often say, “What\\nmakes you think you can do that?” “If it’s such a good idea, how come\\nsomeone else hasn’t done it?” “That will never work. You don’t know\\nwhat you’re talking about.” These words of doubt often get so loud\\n134', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nthat we fail to act. A horrible feeling builds in our stomach. Sometimes\\nwe can’t sleep. We fail to move forward. So we stay with what is\\nsafe, and opportunities pass us by.

We have all felt this at one\\ntime in our lives, some more than others.\\nPeter Lynch of Fidelity Magellan mutual-fund fame refers to\\nwarnings about the sky falling as “noise,” and we all hear it.\\nNoise is either created inside our heads or comes from outside,\\noften from friends, family, co-workers, and the media. Lynch recalls\\nthe time during the 1950s when the threat of nuclear war was so\\nprevalent in the news that people began building fallout shelters and\\nstoring food and water. If they had invested that money wisely in\\nthe market, instead of building a fallout shelter, they’d probably be\\nfinancially independent today.\\nWhen violence breaks out in a city, gun sales go up all over the\\ncountry.

Colds go up as well as\\nsales of cold medicine.\\nMost people are poor because, when it comes to investing, the\\nworld is filled with Chicken Littles running around yelling, “The sky\\nis falling! The sky is falling!” And Chicken Littles are effective, because\\nevery one of us is a little chicken. It often takes great courage to not\\nlet rumors and talk of doom and gloom affect your doubts and fears.\\nBut a savvy investor knows that the seemingly worst of times is actually\\nthe best of times to make money. When everyone else is too afraid to\\nact, they pull the trigger and are rewarded.\\nSome time ago, a friend named Richard came from Boston to visit\\nKim and me in Phoenix. He was impressed with what we had done\\nthrough stocks and real estate. The Phoenix real estate prices were\\ndepressed.

We are strictly investors.\\nAfter identifying a unit in a resort community, we called an agent who\\nsold it to him that afternoon. The price was a mere $42,000 for a\\ntwo-bedroom townhome. Similar units were going for $65,000. He\\nhad found a bargain. Excited, he bought it and returned to Boston.\\nTwo weeks later, the agent called to say that our friend had backed\\nout. I called immediately to find out why. All he said was that he\\ntalked to his neighbor, and his neighbor told him it was a bad deal. He\\nwas paying too much. I asked Richard if his neighbor was an investor.\\nRichard said he was not. When I asked why he listened to him,\\nRichard got defensive and simply said he wanted to keep looking.\\nThe real estate market in Phoenix turned, and a few years later,\\nthat little unit was renting for $1,000 a month—$2,500 in the peak\\nwinter months. The unit was worth $95,000. All Richard had to put\\ndown was $5,000 and he would have had a start at getting out of the\\nRat Race. Today, he still has done nothing.\\nRichard’s backing out did not surprise me. It’s called buyer’s\\nremorse, and it affects all of us.

Almost every time I tell someone that I hold my money\\nthis way, especially if they have money in CDs, they will tell me it’s\\nrisky. They tell me why I should not do it. When I ask them where\\nthey get their information, they say from a friend or an investment\\nmagazine. They’ve never done it, and they’re telling someone who’s\\ndoing it why they shouldn’t.

Doubt is expensive.\\n136', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nMy point is that it’s those doubts and cynicism that keep most\\npeople poor and playing it safe. The real world is simply waiting for\\nyou to get rich. Only a person’s doubts keep them poor. As I said,\\ngetting out of the Rat Race is technically easy. It doesn’t take much\\neducation, but those doubts are cripplers for most people.\\n“Cynics never win,” said rich dad. “Unchecked doubt and fear\\ncreates a cynic.” “Cynics criticize, and winners analyze” was another\\nof his favorite sayings. Rich dad explained that criticism blinded while\\nanalysis opened eyes. Analysis allowed winners to see that critics were\\nblind, and to see opportunities that everyone else missed. And finding\\nwhat people miss is key to any success.\\nReal estate is a powerful investment tool for anyone seeking\\nfinancial independence or freedom. It is a unique investment tool.\\nYet every time I mention real estate as a vehicle, I often hear, “I don’t\\nwant to fix toilets.” That’s what Peter Lynch calls noise. That’s what\\nmy rich dad would say is the cynic talking, someone who criticizes and\\ndoes not analyze, someone who lets their doubts and fears close their\\nmind instead of open their eyes.\\nSo when someone says, “I don’t want to fix toilets,” I want to fire\\nback, “What makes you think I want to?” They’re saying a toilet is\\nmore important than what they want. I talk about freedom from the\\nRat Race, and they focus on toilets. That is the thought pattern that\\nkeeps most people poor. They criticize instead of analyze.\\n“I-don’t-wants hold the key to your success,” rich dad would say.\\nBecause I, too, do not want to fix toilets, I shop hard for a property\\nmanager who does fix toilets. And by finding a great property manager\\nwho runs houses or apartments, well, my cash flow goes up. But, more\\nimportantly, a great property manager allows me to buy a lot more real\\nestate since I don’t have to fix toilets. A great property manager is key to\\nsuccess in real estate. Finding a good manager is more important to me\\nthan the real estate. A great property manager often hears of great deals\\nbefore real estate agents do, which makes them even more valuable.\\nThat is what rich dad meant by “I-don’t-wants hold the key to\\nyour success.” Because I do not want to fix toilets either, I figured out\\n137', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Seven: Overcoming Obstacles\\nhow to buy more real estate and expedite my getting out of the Rat\\nRace. The people who continue to say “I don’t want to fix toilets” often\\ndeny themselves the use of this powerful investment vehicle. Toilets are\\nmore important than their freedom.\\nIn the stock market, I often hear people say, “I don’t want to lose\\nmoney.” Well, what makes them think I or anyone else likes losing\\nmoney? They don’t make money because they choose to not lose\\nmoney. Instead of analyzing, they close their minds to another powerful\\ninvestment vehicle, the stock market.\\nI was riding with a friend past our neighborhood gas station. He\\nlooked up and saw that the price of gas was going up and thus the\\nprice of oil. My friend is a worry wart or a Chicken Little. To him, the\\nsky is always going to fall, and it usually does, on him.\\nWhen we got home, he showed me all the stats as to why the\\nprice of oil was going to go up over the next few years, statistics I had\\nnever seen before, even though I already owned substantial shares of\\nan existing oil company. With that information, I immediately began\\nlooking for and found a new, undervalued oil company that was\\nabout to find some oil deposits. My broker was excited about this\\nnew company, and I bought 15,000 shares for 65 cents per share.\\nThree months later, this same friend and I drove by the same gas\\nstation, and sure enough, the price per gallon had gone up nearly\\n15 percent. Again, the Chicken Little worried and complained. I\\nsmiled because, a month earlier, that little oil company hit oil and\\nthose 15,000 shares went up to more than $3 per share since he had\\nfirst given me the tip. And the price of gas will continue to go up if\\nwhat my friend says is true.\\nIf most people understood how a “stop” worked in stock-market\\ninvesting, there would be more people investing to win instead of\\ninvesting not to lose. A stop is simply a computer command that\\nsells your stock automatically if the price begins to drop, helping to\\nminimize your losses and maximize some gains. It’s a great tool for\\nthose who are terrified of losing.\\nSo whenever I hear people focusing on their I-don’t-wants, rather\\nthan what they do want, I know the noise in their head must be loud.\\nChicken Little has taken over their brain and is yelling, “The sky is\\n138', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nfalling, and toilets are breaking!” So they avoid their don’t-wants, but\\nthey pay a huge price. They may never get what they want in life.\\nInstead of analyzing, their inner Chicken Little closes their mind.\\nRich dad gave me a way of looking at Chicken Little. “Just do what\\nColonel Sanders did.” At the age of 66, he lost his business and began\\nto live on his Social Security check. It wasn’t enough. He went around\\nthe country selling his recipe for fried chicken. He was turned down\\n1,009 times before someone said yes. And he went on to become a\\nmultimillionaire at an age when most people are quitting. “He was a\\nbrave and tenacious man,” rich dad said of Harlan Sanders.\\nSo when you’re in doubt and feeling a little afraid, just do what\\nColonel Sanders did to his little chicken. He fried it.\\nOvercoming Laziness\\nBusy people are often the most lazy. We have all heard stories of a\\nbusinessman who works hard to earn money. He works hard to be a\\ngood provider for his wife and children. He spends long hours at the\\noffice and brings work home on weekends. One day he comes home\\nto an empty house. His wife has left with the kids. He knew he and\\nhis wife had problems, but rather than work to make the relationship\\nstrong, he stayed busy at work. Dismayed, his performance at work\\nslips and he loses his job.\\nToday, I often meet people who are too busy to take care of their\\nwealth. And there are people too busy to take care of their health. The\\ncause is the same. They’re busy, and they stay busy as a way of avoiding\\nsomething they do not want to face. Nobody has to tell them. Deep\\ndown they know. In fact, if you remind them, they often respond with\\nanger or irritation.\\nIf they aren’t busy at work or with the kids, they’re often busy\\nwatching TV, fishing, playing golf, or shopping. Yet deep down\\nthey know they are avoiding something important. That’s the most\\ncommon form of laziness: laziness by staying busy.\\nSo what is the cure for laziness? The answer is—a little greed.\\nFor many of us, we were raised thinking of greed or desire as bad.\\n“Greedy people are bad people,” my mom used to say. Yet we all have\\ninside of us this yearning to have nice, new, or exciting things.\\n139', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Seven: Overcoming Obstacles\\nSo to keep that emotion of desire under control, often parents\\nfind ways of suppressing that desire with guilt. “You only think about\\nyourself. Don’t you know you have brothers and sisters?” was one of\\nmy mom’s favorites. “You want me to buy you what?” was a favorite of\\nmy dad. “Do you think we’re made of money? Do you think money\\ngrows on trees? We’re not rich people, you know.”\\nIt wasn’t so much the words, but the angry guilt trip that went\\nwith the words that got to me.\\nOr the reverse guilt trip was the “I’m sacrificing my life to buy\\nthis for you. I’m buying this for you because I never had this advantage\\nwhen I was a kid.” I have a neighbor who is stone-broke but can’t park\\nhis car in his garage. The garage is filled with toys for his kids. Those\\nspoiled brats get everything they ask for.\\n“I don’t want them to know the\\nRich dad believed\\nfeeling of want” are his everyday\\nthat the words\\nwords. He has nothing set aside for\\n“I can’t afford it” their college or his retirement, but\\nshut down your brain. his kids have every toy ever made.\\n“How can I afford it?” He recently got a new credit card in\\nopens up possibilities, the mail and took his kids to visit Las\\nexcitement, and dreams. Vegas. “I’m doing it for the kids,” he\\nsaid with great sacrifice.\\nRich dad forbade the words, “I can’t afford it.” In my real home,\\nthat’s all I heard. Instead, rich dad required his children to say, “How\\ncan I afford it?” He believed that the words “I can’t afford it” shut\\ndown your brain. It didn’t have to think anymore. “How can I afford\\nit?” opened up the brain and forced it to think and search for answers.\\nBut most importantly, he felt the words, “I can’t afford it,” were\\na lie. And the human spirit knows it. “The human spirit is very, very\\npowerful,” he would say. “It knows it can do anything.” By having a\\nlazy mind that says, “I can’t afford it,” a war breaks out inside you. Your\\nspirit is angry, and your lazy mind must defend its lie. The spirit is\\nscreaming, “Come on. Let’s go to the gym and work out.” And the lazy\\nmind says, “But I’m tired. I worked really hard today.” Or the human\\n140', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nspirit says, “I’m sick and tired of being poor. Let’s get out there and get\\nrich.” To which the lazy mind says, “Rich people are greedy. Besides it’s\\ntoo much bother. It’s not safe. I might lose money. I’m working hard\\nenough as it is. I’ve got too much to do at work anyway. Look at what\\nI have to do tonight. My boss wants it finished by morning.”\\n“I can’t afford it” also causes sadness, a helplessness that leads\\nto despondency and often depression. “How can I afford it?” opens\\nup possibilities, excitement, and dreams. So rich dad was not so\\nconcerned about what we wanted to buy as long as we understood that\\n“How can I afford it?” creates a stronger mind and a dynamic spirit.\\nThus he rarely gave Mike or me anything. He would instead ask,\\n“How can you afford it?” and that included college, which we paid\\nfor ourselves. It was not the goal, but the process of attaining the goal\\nthat he wanted us to learn.\\nThe problem I see today is that there are millions of people who\\nfeel guilty about their desire or their “greed.” It’s old conditioning\\nfrom their childhood. While they desire to have the finer things that\\nlife offers, most have been conditioned subconsciously to say, “I can’t\\nhave that,” or “I’ll never be able to afford that.”\\nWhen I decided to exit the Rat Race, it was simply a question\\nof “How can I afford to never work again?” And my mind began to\\nkick out answers and solutions. The hardest part was fighting my real\\nparents’ dogma: “We can’t afford that.” “Stop thinking only about\\nyourself.” “Why don’t you think about others?” and other similar\\nsentiments designed to instill guilt to suppress my “greed.”\\nSo how do you beat laziness? Once again, the answer is a little\\ngreed. It’s that radio station WII-FM, which stands for “What’s In\\nIt For Me?” A person needs to sit down and ask, “What would my\\nlife be like if I never had to work again?” “What would I do if I had\\nall the money I needed?” Without that little greed, the desire to have\\nsomething better, progress is not made. Our world progresses because\\nwe all desire a better life. New inventions are made because we desire\\nsomething better. We go to school and study hard because we want\\nsomething better. So whenever you find yourself avoiding something\\n141', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Seven: Overcoming Obstacles\\nyou know you should be doing, then the only thing to ask yourself is,\\n“What’s in it for me?” Be a little greedy. It’s the best cure for laziness.\\nToo much greed, however, as anything in excess can be, is not good.\\nBut just remember what Michael Douglas said in the movie Wall Street:\\n“Greed is good.” Rich dad said it differently: “Guilt is worse than greed,\\nfor guilt robs the body of its soul.” I think Eleanor Roosevelt said it best:\\n“Do what you feel in your heart to be right—for you’ll be criticized\\nanyway. You’ll be damned if you do, and damned if you don’t.”\\nOvercoming Bad Habits\\nOur lives are a reflection of our habits more than our education. After\\nseeing the movie Conan the Barbarian, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger,\\na friend said, “I’d love to have a body like Schwarzenegger.” Most of the\\nguys nodded in agreement.\\n“I even heard he was really puny and skinny at one time,” another\\nfriend added.\\n“Yeah, I heard that too,” another one said. “I heard he has a habit of\\nworking out almost every day in the gym.”\\n“Yeah, I’ll bet he has to.”\\n“Nah,” said the group cynic. “I’ll bet he was born that way. Besides,\\nlet’s stop talking about Arnold and get some beers.”\\nThis is an example of habits controlling behavior. I remember\\nasking my rich dad about the habits of the rich. Instead of answering me\\noutright, he wanted me to learn through example, as usual.\\n“When does your dad pay his bills?” rich dad asked.\\n“The first of the month,” I said.\\n“Does he have anything left over?” he asked.\\n“Very little,” I said.\\n“That’s the main reason he struggles,” said rich dad. “He has\\nbad habits. Your dad pays everyone else first. He pays himself last, but\\nonly if he has anything left over.”\\n“Which he usually doesn’t,” I said. “But he has to pay his bills, doesn’t\\nhe? You’re saying he shouldn’t pay his bills?”\\n142', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\n“Of course not,” said rich dad. “I firmly believe in paying my bills on\\ntime. I just pay myself first. Before I pay even the government.”\\n“But what happens if you don’t have enough money?” I asked.\\n“What do you do then?”\\n“The same,” said rich dad. “I still pay myself first. Even if I’m\\nshort of money. My asset column is far more important to me than\\nthe government.”\\n“But,” I said. “Don’t they come after you?”\\n“Yes, if you don’t pay,” said rich dad. “Look, I did not say not to pay.\\nI just said I pay myself first, even if I’m short of money.”\\n“But,” I replied. “How do you do that?”\\n“It’s not how. The question is ‘Why?’” rich dad said.\\n“Okay, why?”\\n“Motivation,” said rich dad. “Who do you think will complain\\nlouder if I don’t pay them—me, or my creditors?”\\n“Your creditors will definitely scream louder than you,” I said,\\nresponding to the obvious. “You wouldn’t say anything if you didn’t\\npay yourself.”\\n“So you see, after paying myself, the pressure to pay my taxes and\\nthe other creditors is so great that it forces me to seek other forms of\\nincome. The pressure to pay becomes my motivation. I’ve worked extra\\njobs, started other companies, traded in the stock market, anything just\\nto make sure those guys don’t start yelling at me. That pressure made me\\nwork harder, forced me to think, and all in all, made me smarter and\\nmore active when it comes to money. If I had paid myself last, I would\\nhave felt no pressure, but I’d be broke.”\\n“So it is the fear of the government or other people you owe money\\nto that motivates you?”\\n“That’s right,” said rich dad. “You see, government bill collectors are\\nbig bullies. So are bill collectors in general. Most people give into these\\nbullies. They pay them and never pay themselves. You know the story of\\nthe 98-pound weakling who gets sand kicked in his face?”\\nI nodded. “I see that ad for weightlifting and bodybuilding lessons\\nin the comic books all the time.”\\n143', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Seven: Overcoming Obstacles\\n“Well, most people let the bullies\\nIf I pay myself first,\\nkick sand in their faces. I decided to\\nI get financially stronger,\\nuse the fear of the bully to make me\\nmentally and fiscally.\\nstronger. Others get weaker. Forcing\\nmyself to think about how to make\\nextra money is like going to the gym and working out with weights. The\\nmore I work my mental money muscles out, the stronger I get. Now I’m\\nnot afraid of those bullies.”\\nI liked what rich dad was saying. “So if I pay myself first, I get\\nfinancially stronger, mentally and fiscally.”\\nRich dad nodded.\\n“And if I pay myself last, or not at all, I get weaker. So people like\\nbosses, managers, tax collectors, bill collectors, and landlords push me\\naround all my life—just because I don’t have good money habits.”\\nRich dad nodded. “Just like the 98-pound weakling.”\\nOvercoming Arrogance\\n“What I know makes me money. What I don’t know loses me\\nmoney. Every time I have been arrogant, I have lost money. Because\\nwhen I’m arrogant, I truly believe that what I don’t know is not\\nimportant,” rich dad would often tell me.\\nI have found that many people use arrogance to try to hide their own\\nignorance. It often happens when I am discussing financial statements\\nwith accountants or even other investors.\\nThey try to bluster their way through the discussion. It is clear to me\\nthat they don’t know what they’re talking about. They’re not lying, but\\nthey are not telling the truth.\\nThere are many people in the world of money, finances, and\\ninvestments who have absolutely no idea what they’re talking about.\\nMost people in the money industry are just spouting off sales pitches\\nlike used-car salesmen. When you know you are ignorant in a subject,\\nstart educating yourself by finding an expert in the field or a book on\\nthe subject.\\n144', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Eight\\nGETTING STARTED\\nThere is gold everywhere.\\nMost people are not trained to see it.\\nI wish I could say acquiring wealth was easy for me, but it wasn’t.\\nSo in response to the question “How do I start?” I offer the thought\\nprocess I go through on a day-to-day basis. It really is easy to find\\ngreat deals. I promise you that. It’s just like riding a bike. After a little\\nwobbling, it’s a piece of cake. But when it comes to money, it takes\\ndetermination to get through the wobbling. That’s a personal thing.\\nTo find million-dollar “deals of a lifetime” requires us to call on our\\nfinancial genius. I believe that each of us has a financial genius within us.\\nThe problem is that our financial genius lies asleep, waiting to be called\\nupon. It lies asleep because our culture has educated us into believing that\\nthe love of money is the root of all evil. It has encouraged us to learn a\\nprofession so we can work for money, but failed to teach us how to have\\nmoney work for us. It taught us not to worry about our financial future\\nbecause our company or the government would take care of us when\\nour working days are over. However, it is our children, educated in the\\nsame school system, who will end up paying for this absence of financial\\neducation. The message is still to work hard, earn money, and spend it,\\nand when we run short, we can always borrow more.\\nUnfortunately, 90 percent of the Western world subscribes to the\\nabove dogma, simply because it’s easier to find a job and work for\\nmoney. If you are not one of the masses, I offer you the following\\n10 steps to awaken your financial genius. I simply offer you the steps\\n145', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Eight: Getting Started\\nI have personally followed. If you want to follow some of them, great.\\nIf you don’t, make up your own. Your financial genius is smart enough\\nto develop its own list.\\nWhile in Peru, I asked a gold miner of 45 years how he was so\\nconfident about finding a gold mine. He replied, “There is gold\\neverywhere. Most people are not trained to see it.”\\nAnd I would say that is true. In real estate, I can go out and\\nin a day come up with four or five great potential deals, while the\\naverage person will go out and find nothing, even looking in the same\\nneighborhood. The reason is that they have not taken the time to\\ndevelop their financial genius.\\nI offer you the following 10 steps as a process to develop your\\nGod-given powers, powers over which only you have control.\\n1. Find a reason greater than reality: the power of spirit\\nIf you ask most people if they would like to be rich or financially\\nfree, they would say yes. But then reality sets in. The road seems too\\nlong with too many hills to climb. It’s easier to just work for money\\nand hand the excess over to your broker.\\nI once met a young woman who had dreams of swimming for\\nthe U.S. Olympic team. The reality was that she had to get up every\\nmorning at four o’clock to swim for three hours before going to\\nschool. She did not party with her friends on Saturday night. She had\\nto study and keep her grades up, just like everyone else.\\nWhen I asked her what fueled her super-human ambition and\\nsacrifice, she simply said, “I do it for myself and the people I love. It’s\\nlove that gets me over the hurdles and sacrifices.”\\nA reason or a purpose is a combination of “wants” and “don’t\\nwants.” When people ask me what my reason for wanting to be rich\\nis, I tell them that it is a combination of deep emotional “wants” and\\n“don’t wants.”\\nI will list a few: first, the “don’t wants,” for they create the “wants.”\\nI don’t want to work all my life. I don’t want what my parents aspired for,\\nwhich was job security and a house in the suburbs. I don’t like being an\\nemployee. I hated that my dad always missed my football games because\\n146', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nhe was so busy working on his career. I hated it when my dad worked\\nhard all his life and the government took most of what he worked for\\nat his death. He could not even pass on what he worked so hard for\\nwhen he died. The rich don’t do that. They work hard and pass it on\\nto their children.\\nNow the “wants.” I want to be free to travel the world and live\\nin the lifestyle I love. I want to be young when I do this. I want\\nto simply be free. I want control over my time and my life. I want\\nmoney to work for me.\\nThose are my deep-seated emotional reasons. What are yours?\\nIf they are not strong enough, then the reality of the road ahead may\\nbe greater than your reasons. I have lost money and been set back many\\ntimes, but it was the deep emotional reasons that kept me standing up\\nand going forward. I wanted to be free by age 40, but it took me until\\nI was 47, with many learning experiences along the way.\\nAs I said, I wish I could say it was easy. It wasn’t. But it wasn’t\\nthat hard either. I’ve learned that, without a strong reason or purpose,\\nanything in life is hard.\\nIF YOU DO NOT HAVE A STRONG REASON, THERE IS NO SENSE\\nREADING FURTHER. IT WILL SOUND LIKE TOO MUCH WORK.\\n2. Make daily choices: the power of choice\\nChoice is the main reason people want to live in a free country.\\nWe want the power to choose.\\nFinancially, with every dollar we get in our hands, we hold the\\npower to choose our future: to be rich, poor, or middle class. Our\\nspending habits reflect who we are. Poor people simply have poor\\nspending habits. The benefit I had as a boy was that I loved playing\\nMonopoly constantly. Nobody told me Monopoly was only for kids,\\nso I just kept playing the game as an adult. I also had a rich dad who\\npointed out to me the difference between an asset and a liability. So\\na long time ago, as a little boy, I chose to be rich, and I knew that\\nall I had to do was learn to acquire assets, real assets. My best friend,\\nMike, had an asset column handed to him, but he still had to choose\\n147', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Eight: Getting Started\\nto learn to keep it. Many rich families lose their assets in the next\\ngeneration simply because there was no one trained to be a good\\nsteward over their assets.\\nMost people choose not to be rich. For 90 percent of the population,\\nbeing rich is too much of a hassle. So they invent sayings that go: “I’m\\nnot interested in money.” “I’ll never be rich.” “I don’t have to worry.\\nI’m still young.” “When I make some money, then I’ll think about my\\nfuture.” “My husband/wife handles the finances.” The problem with\\nthose statements is that they rob the person who chooses to think such\\nthoughts of two things: One is time, which is your most precious asset.\\nThe second is learning. Having no money should not be an excuse to\\nnot learn. But that is a choice we all make daily: the choice of what we\\ndo with our time, our money, and what we put in our heads. That is\\nthe power of choice. All of us have choice. I just choose to be rich, and\\nI make that choice every day.\\nInvest first in education. In reality, the only real asset you have is your\\nmind, the most powerful tool we have dominion over. Each of us has the\\nchoice of what we put in our brain once we’re old enough. You can watch\\nTV, read golf magazines, or go to ceramics class or a class on financial\\nplanning. You choose. Most people simply buy investments rather than\\nfirst investing in learning about investing.\\nA friend of mine recently had her apartment burglarized. The\\nthieves took her electronics and left all the books. And we all have that\\nsame choice. 90 percent of the population buys TV sets, and only about\\n10 percent buy business books.\\nSo what do I do? I go to seminars. I like it when they are at least two\\ndays long because I like to immerse myself in a subject. In 1973, I was\\nwatching this guy on TV who was advertising a three-day seminar on\\nhow to buy real estate for nothing down. I spent $385 and that course\\nhas made me at least $2 million, if not more. But more importantly, it\\nbought me life. I don’t have to work for the rest of my life because of\\nthat one course. I go to at least two such courses every year.\\nI love CDs and audio books. The reason: I can easily review what\\nI just heard. I was listening to an investor say something I completely\\ndisagreed with. Instead of becoming arrogant and critical, I simply\\n148', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nlistened to that five-minute stretch at least 20 times, maybe more. But\\nsuddenly, by keeping my mind open, I understood why he said what he\\nsaid. It was like magic. I felt like I had a window into the mind of one of\\nthe greatest investors of our time. I gained tremendous insight into the\\nvast resources of his education and experience.\\nThe net result: I still have the old way I used to think, and I now\\nhave a new way of looking at the same problem or situation. I have two\\nways to analyze a problem or trend, and that is priceless. Today, I often\\nsay, “How would Donald Trump do this, or Warren Buffett or George\\nSoros?” The only way I can access their vast mental power is to be humble\\nenough to read or listen to what they have to say. Arrogant or critical\\npeople are often people with low self-esteem who are afraid of taking\\nrisks. That’s because, if you learn something new, you are then required\\nto make mistakes in order to fully understand what you have learned.\\nIf you have read this far, arrogance is not one of your problems.\\nArrogant people rarely read or listen to experts. Why should they?\\nThey are the center of the universe.\\nThere are so many “intelligent” people who argue or defend when\\na new idea clashes with the way they think. In this case, their so-called\\nintelligence combined with arrogance equals ignorance. Each of us\\nknows people who are highly educated, or believe they are smart, but\\ntheir balance sheet paints a different picture. A truly intelligent person\\nwelcomes new ideas, for new ideas can add to the synergy of other\\naccumulated ideas. Listening is more important than talking. If that\\nwere not true, God would not have given us two ears and only one\\nmouth. Too many people think with their mouth instead of listening\\nin order to absorb new ideas and possibilities. They argue instead of\\nasking questions.\\nI take a long view on my wealth. I do not subscribe to the\\nget-rich-quick mentality most lottery players or casino gamblers have.\\nI may go in and out of stocks, but I am long on education. If you\\nwant to fly an airplane, I advise taking lessons first. I am always\\nshocked at people who buy stocks or real estate, but never invest in\\ntheir greatest asset, their mind. Just because you bought a house or\\ntwo does not make you an expert at real estate.\\n149', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Eight: Getting Started\\n3. Choose friends carefully: the power of association\\nFirst of all, I do not choose my friends by their financial statements.\\nI have friends who have actually taken a vow of poverty as well as friends\\nwho earn millions every year. The point is that I learn from all of them.\\nNow, I will admit that there are people I have actually sought out\\nbecause they had money. But I was not after their money; I was\\nseeking their knowledge. In some cases, these people who had money\\nhave become dear friends. I’ve noticed that my friends with money\\ntalk about money. They don’t do it to brag. They’re interested in the\\nsubject. So I learn from them, and they learn from me. My friends\\nwho are in dire financial straits do not like talking about money,\\nbusiness, or investing. They often think it rude or unintellectual. So\\nI also learn from my friends who struggle financially. I find out what\\nnot to do.\\nI have several friends who have generated over a billion dollars in\\ntheir short lifetimes. The three of them report the same phenomenon:\\nTheir friends who have no money have never come to them to ask\\nthem how they did it. But they do come asking for one of two things,\\nor both: a loan, or a job.\\nWARNING: Don’t listen to poor or frightened people. I have such friends, and\\nwhile I love them dearly, they are the Chicken Littles of life. To them, when it\\ncomes to money, especially investments, it’s always, “The sky is falling! The sky\\nis falling!” They can always tell you why something won’t work. The problem\\nis that people listen to them. But people who blindly accept doom-and-gloom\\ninformation are also Chicken Littles. As that old saying goes, “Birds of a feather\\nflock together.”\\nIf you watch business channels on TV, they often have a panel\\nof so-called experts. One expert will say the market is going to crash,\\nand the other will say it’s going to boom. If you’re smart, you listen\\nto both. Keep your mind open, because both have valid points.\\nUnfortunately, most poor people listen to Chicken Little.\\nI have had many close friends try to talk me out of a deal or an\\ninvestment. Not long ago, a friend told me he was excited because he\\nfound a 6 percent certificate of deposit. I told him I earn 16 percent\\n150', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nfrom the state government. The next day he sent me an article about\\nwhy my investment was dangerous. I have received 16 percent for\\nyears now, and he still receives 6 percent.\\nI would say that one of the hardest things about wealth-building is\\nto be true to yourself and to be willing to not go along with the crowd.\\nThis is because, in the market, it is usually the crowd that shows up\\nlate that is slaughtered. If a great deal is on the front page, it’s too late\\nin most instances. Look for a new deal. As we used to say as surfers:\\n“There is always another wave.” People who hurry and catch a wave\\nlate usually are the ones who wipe out.\\nSmart investors don’t time the markets. If they miss a wave, they\\nsearch for the next one and get themselves in position. This is hard\\nfor most investors because buying what is not popular is frightening.\\nTimid investors are like sheep going along with the crowd. Or their\\ngreed gets them in when wise investors have already taken their\\nprofits and moved on. Wise investors buy an investment when it’s not\\npopular. They know their profits are made when they buy, not when\\nthey sell. They wait patiently. As I said, they do not time the market.\\nJust like a surfer, they get in position for the next big swell.\\nIt’s all “insider trading.” There are forms of insider trading that are\\nillegal, and there are forms of insider trading that are legal. But either\\nway, it’s insider trading. The only distinction is: How far away from\\nthe inside are you? The reason you want to have rich friends is because\\nthat is where the money is made. It’s made on information. You want\\nto hear about the next boom, get in, and get out before the next bust.\\nI’m not saying do it illegally, but the sooner you know, the better your\\nchances are for profits with minimal risk. That is what friends are for.\\nAnd that is financial intelligence.\\n4. Master a formula and then learn a new one: the power of\\nlearning quickly\\nIn order to make bread, every baker follows a recipe, even if it’s\\nonly held in their head. The same is true for making money.\\nMost of us have heard the saying, “You are what you eat.” I have\\na different slant.

The\\npredominant formula I see in the world is that every day millions of\\npeople get up, go to work, earn money, pay bills, balance checkbooks,\\nbuy some mutual funds, and go back to work. That is the basic\\nformula, or recipe.\\nIf you’re tired of what you’re doing, or you’re not making enough,\\nit’s simply a case of changing the formula via which you make money.\\nYears ago, when I was 26, I took a weekend class called “How to\\nBuy Real Estate Foreclosures.” I learned a formula. The next trick was\\nto have the discipline to actually put into action what I had learned.\\nThat is where most people stop. For three years, while working for\\nXerox, I spent my spare time learning to master the art of buying\\nforeclosures. I’ve made several million dollars using that formula.\\nSo after I mastered that formula, I went in search of other formulas.\\nFor many of the classes, I did not directly use the information I learned,\\nbut I always learned something new.\\nI have attended classes designed for derivative traders, commodity\\noption traders, and chaologists. I was way out of my league, being in a\\nroom full of people with doctorates in nuclear physics and space science.\\nYet, I learned a lot that made my stock and real estate investing more\\nmeaningful and lucrative.\\nMost junior colleges and community colleges have classes on\\nfinancial planning and buying traditional investments. They are good\\nplaces to start, but I always search for a faster formula. That is why,\\non a fairly regular basis, I make more in a day than many people will\\nmake in their lifetime.\\nAnother side note: In today’s fast-changing world, it’s not so much\\nwhat you know anymore that counts, because often what you know is\\nold. It is how fast you learn. That skill is priceless.

It is the lack of self-discipline that causes people who\\nget a raise to immediately go out and buy a new car or take a cruise.\\nIt is difficult to say which of the 10 steps is the most important.\\nBut of all the steps, this step is probably the most difficult to master\\nif it is not already a part of your makeup. I would venture to say that\\npersonal self-discipline is the number-one delineating factor between\\nthe rich, the poor, and the middle class.\\nSimply put, people who have low self-esteem and low tolerance for\\nfinancial pressure can never be rich. As I have said, a lesson learned from\\nmy rich dad was that the world will push you around. The world pushes\\npeople around, not because other people are bullies, but because the\\nindividual lacks internal control and discipline. People who lack internal\\nfortitude often become victims of those who have self-discipline.\\nIn the entrepreneur classes I teach, I constantly remind people\\nto not focus on their product, service, or widget, but to focus on\\ndeveloping management skills. The three most important management\\nskills necessary to start your own business are management of:\\n1. Cash flow\\n2. People\\n3.

I still paid myself first. My accountant\\nand bookkeeper screamed in panic, “They’re going to come after you.\\nThe IRS is going to put you in jail.” “You’re going to ruin your credit\\nrating.” “They’ll cut off the electricity.” I still paid myself first.\\n“Why?” you ask. Because that’s what the story, The Richest Man In\\nBabylon, was all about: the power of self-discipline and the power of\\ninternal fortitude. As my rich dad taught me the first month I worked\\nfor him, most people allow the world to push them around. A bill\\ncollector calls and you “pay or else.” A sales clerk says, “Oh, just put it\\non your charge card.” Your real estate agent tells you, “Go ahead.\\nThe government allows you a tax deduction on your home.” That is\\nwhat the book is really about—having the guts to go against the tide\\nand get rich. You may not be weak, but when it comes to money,\\nmany people get wimpy.\\nI am not saying be irresponsible. The reason I don’t have high\\ncredit-card debt, and doodad debt, is because I pay myself first. The\\nreason I minimize my income is because I don’t want to pay it to the\\ngovernment. That is why my income comes from my asset column,\\nthrough a Nevada corporation. If I work for money, the government\\ntakes it.\\nAlthough I pay my bills last, I am financially astute enough to not\\nget into a tough financial situation. I don’t like consumer debt. I actually\\nhave liabilities that are higher than 99 percent of the population, but I\\ndon’t pay for them. Other people pay for my liabilities. They’re called\\ntenants. So rule number one in paying yourself first is: Don’t get into\\nconsumer debt in the first place. Although I pay my bills last, I set it up\\nto have only small unimportant bills that are due.\\n156', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nWhen I occasionally come up short, I still pay myself first. I let\\nthe creditors and even the government scream. I like it when they get\\ntough. Why? Because those guys do me a favor. They inspire me to go\\nout and create more money. So I pay myself first, invest the money,\\nand let the creditors yell. I generally pay them right away anyway. Kim\\nand I have excellent credit. We just don’t cave in to pressure and spend\\nour savings or liquidate stocks to pay for consumer debt. That is not\\ntoo financially intelligent.\\nTo successfully pay yourself first, keep the following in mind:\\n1. Don’t get into large debt positions that you have to pay for. Keep\\nyour expenses low. Build up assets first. Then buy the big house or\\nnice car. Being stuck in the Rat Race is not intelligent.\\n2. When you come up short, let the pressure build and don’t dip\\ninto your savings or investments. Use the pressure to inspire\\nyour financial genius to come up with new ways of making more\\nmoney, and then pay your bills. You will have increased your\\nability to make more money as well as your financial intelligence.\\nSo many times I have gotten into financial hot water and used my\\nbrain to create more income while staunchly defending the assets in my\\nasset column. My bookkeeper has screamed and dived for cover, but I\\nwas like a good soldier defending the fort—Fort Assets.\\nPoor people have poor habits. A common bad habit is innocently\\ncalled “dipping into savings.” The rich know that savings are only used to\\ncreate more money, not to pay bills.\\nI know that sounds tough, but as I said, if you’re not tough inside,\\nthe world will always push you around anyway.\\nIf you do not like financial pressure, then find a formula that works\\nfor you. A good one is to cut expenses, put your money in the bank, pay\\nmore than your fair share of income tax, buy safe mutual funds, and take\\nthe vow of the average.

And that is financial intelligence.\\n6. Pay your brokers well: the power of good advice\\nSometimes I see people posting a sign in front of their house that\\nsays, “For Sale by Owner.” Or I see people on TV claiming to be\\n“Discount Brokers.”\\nMy rich dad taught me to take the opposite approach. He believed\\nin paying professionals well, and I have adopted that policy also.\\nToday, I have expensive attorneys, accountants, real estate brokers,\\nand stockbrokers. Why? Because if, and I do mean if, the people are\\nprofessionals, their services should make you money. And the more\\nmoney they make, the more money I make.\\nWe live in the Information Age. Information is priceless. A good\\nbroker should provide you with information, as well as take the time to\\neducate you. I have several brokers who do that for me. Some taught\\nme when I had little or no money, and I am still with them today.\\nWhat I pay a broker is tiny in comparison with what kind of\\nmoney I can make because of the information they provide. I love\\nit when my real estate broker or stockbroker makes a lot of money\\nbecause that usually means I made a lot of money.\\nA good broker saves me time, in addition to making me money—\\nlike when I bought the vacant land for $9,000 and sold it immediately\\nfor over $25,000 so I could buy my Porsche quicker.\\nA broker is my eyes and ears in the market. They’re there every day\\nso I do not have to be. I’d rather play golf.\\nPeople who sell their house on their own must not value their time\\nmuch. Why would I want to save a few bucks when I could use that\\ntime to make more money or spend it with those I love? What I find\\nfunny is that so many poor and middle-class people insist on tipping\\nrestaurant help 15 to 20 percent, even for bad service, but complain\\nabout paying a broker three to seven percent. They enjoy tipping\\npeople in the expense column and stiffing people in the asset column.\\nThat is not financially intelligent.\\n158', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nKeep in mind that not all brokers are created equal. Unfortunately,\\nmost brokers are only salespeople. They sell, but they themselves own\\nlittle or no real estate. There is a tremendous difference between a broker\\nwho sells houses and a broker who sells investments. The same is true for\\nstock, bond, mutual fund, and insurance, brokers who call themselves\\nfinancial planners.\\nWhen I interview any paid professional, I first find out how much\\nproperty or stocks they personally own and what percentage they pay in\\ntaxes. And that applies to my tax attorney as well as my accountant.\\nI have an accountant who minds his own business. His profession is\\naccounting, but his business is real estate. I used to have an accountant\\nwho was a small-business accountant, but he had no real estate. I\\nswitched because we did not love the same business.\\nFind a broker who has your best interests at heart. Many brokers will\\nspend the time educating you, and they could be the best asset you find.\\nJust be fair, and most of them will be fair to you. If all you can think\\nabout is cutting their commissions, then why should they want to help\\nyou? It’s just simple logic.\\nAs I said earlier, one of the management skills is the management\\nof people. Many people only manage people they feel smarter than and\\nthey have power over. Many middle managers remain middle managers,\\nfailing to get promoted, because they know how to work with people\\nbelow them, but not with people above them. The real skill is to manage\\nand reward the people who are smarter than you in some technical area.\\nThat is why companies have a board of directors. You should have one\\ntoo. That is financial intelligence.\\n7. Be an Indian giver: the power of getting something for nothing\\nWhen the first European settlers came to America, they were taken\\naback by a cultural practice some American Indians had. For example, if a\\nsettler was cold, the Indian would give the person a blanket. Mistaking it\\nfor a gift, the settler was often offended when the Indian asked for it back.\\nThe Indians also got upset when they realized the settlers did not\\nwant to give it back. That is where the term “Indian giver” came from,\\na simple cultural misunderstanding.\\n159', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Eight: Getting Started\\nIn the world of the asset column, being an Indian giver is vital to\\nwealth. The sophisticated investor’s first question is: “How fast do I\\nget my money back?” They also want to know what they get for free,\\nalso called a “piece of the action.” That is why the ROI, or return on\\ninvestment, is so important.\\nFor example, I found a small condominium that was in foreclosure\\na few blocks from where I lived. The bank wanted $60,000, and I\\nsubmitted a bid for $50,000, which\\nThe sophisticated they took, simply because, along\\ninvestor’s first with my bid, was a cashier’s check for\\nquestion is: $50,000. They realized I was serious.\\n“How fast do I get my Most investors would say, “Aren’t you\\nmoney back?” tying up a lot of cash? Would it not be\\nbetter to get a loan on it?” The answer\\nis, “Not in this case.” My investment company uses this condominium\\nas a vacation rental in the winter months when the “snowbirds”\\ncome to Arizona. It rents for $2,500 a month for four months out of\\nthe year. For rental during the off-season, it rents for only $1,000 a\\nmonth. I had my money back in about three years. Now I own this\\nasset, which pumps money out for me, month in and month out.\\nThe same is done with stocks. Frequently, my broker calls and\\nrecommends I move a sizable amount of money into the stock of a\\ncompany that he feels is just about to make a move that will add value\\nto the stock, like announcing a new product. I will move my money\\nin for a week to a month while the stock moves up. Then I pull my\\ninitial dollar amount out, and stop worrying about the fluctuations of\\nthe market, because my initial money is back and ready to work on\\nanother asset. So my money goes in, and then it comes out, and I own\\nan asset that was technically free.\\nTrue, I have lost money on many occasions, but I only play with\\nmoney I can afford to lose. I would say, on an average 10 investments,\\nI hit home runs on two or three, while five or six do nothing, and I\\nlose on two or three. But I limit my losses to only the money I have in\\nat that time.\\n160', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nPeople who hate risk put their money in the bank. In the long run,\\nsafe savings are better than no savings. But it takes a long time to get\\nyour money back and, in most instances, you don’t get anything for\\nfree with it.\\nOn every one of my investments, there must be an upside,\\nsomething for free—like a condominium, a mini-storage, a piece\\nof free land, a house, stock shares, or an office building. And there\\nmust be limited risk, or a low-risk idea. There are books devoted\\nentirely to this subject, so I will not talk about it here. Ray Kroc, of\\nMcDonald’s fame, sold hamburger franchises, not because he loved\\nhamburgers, but because he wanted the real estate under the franchise\\nfor free.\\nSo wise investors must look at more than ROI. They look at\\nthe assets they get for free once they get their money back. That is\\nfinancial intelligence.\\n8. Use assets to buy luxuries: the power of focus\\nA friend’s child has been developing a nasty habit of burning a\\nhole in his pocket. Just 16, he wanted his own car.

That was when his father called\\nme and then came to see me.\\n“Do you think I should let him do it, or should I just buy him a car?”\\nI answered, “It might relieve the pressure in the short term, but what\\nhave you taught him in the long term? Can you use this desire to own a\\ncar and inspire your son to learn something?” Suddenly the lights went\\non, and he hurried home.\\nTwo months later I ran into my friend again. “Does your son have\\nhis new car?” I asked.\\n“No, he doesn’t. But I gave him $3,000 for the car. I told him to\\nuse my money instead of his college money.”\\n“Well, that’s generous of you,” I said.\\n“Not really. The money came with a hitch.”\\n161', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Eight: Getting Started\\n“So what was the hitch?” I asked.\\n“Well, first we played your CASHFLOW game. We then had\\na long discussion about the wise use of money. After that, I gave him\\na subscription to the Wall Street Journal and a few books on the\\nstock market.”\\n“Then what?” I asked. “What was the catch?”\\n“I told him the $3,000 was his, but he could not directly buy a car\\nwith it. He could use it to find a stockbroker and buy and sell stocks.\\nOnce he had made $6,000 with the $3,000, the money would be his\\nfor the car, and the $3,000 would go into his college fund.”\\n“And what are the results?” I asked.\\n“Well, he got lucky early in his trading, but lost everything a few\\ndays later. Then he really got interested. Today, I would say he is down\\n$2,000, but his interest is up. He has read all the books I bought him,\\nand he’s gone to the library to get more. He reads the Wall Street Journal\\nvoraciously, watching for indicators. He’s got only $1,000 left, but his\\ninterest and learning are sky-high. He knows that if he loses that money,\\nhe walks for two more years. But he does not seem to care. He even seems\\nuninterested in getting a car, because he’s found a game that is more fun.”\\n“What happens if he loses all the money?” I asked.\\n“We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it. I’d rather have him lose\\neverything now than wait till he’s our age to risk losing everything.\\nAnd besides, that is the best $3,000 I’ve ever spent on his education.\\nWhat he is learning will serve him for life, and he seems to have gained\\na new respect for the power of money.”\\nAs I said earlier, if a person cannot master the power of self-\\ndiscipline, it is best not to try to get rich. I say this because, although\\nthe process of developing cash flow from an asset column is easy in\\ntheory, what’s hard is the mental fortitude to direct money to the\\ncorrect use. Due to external temptations, it is much easier in today’s\\nconsumer world to simply blow money out the expense column.\\nWith weak mental fortitude, that money flows into the paths of\\nleast resistance. That is the cause of poverty and financial struggle.\\nThe following example illustrates the financial intelligence needed\\nto direct money to make more money.\\n162', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nIf we give 100 people $10,000 at the start of the year, I believe that\\nat the end of the year:\\n• 80 would have nothing left.

The difference is I don’t\\nbuy them on credit. It’s the keep-up-with-the-Joneses trap. When I\\nwanted to buy a Porsche, the easy road would have been to call my\\nbanker and get a loan.

One is easier in the\\nshort term, but harder in the long term. It’s a bad habit that we as\\nindividuals, and as a nation, have gotten into.

Immediately,\\nI invited her to lunch. She was thrilled to tell me everything\\nshe knew and how to do it. After lunch, she spent all\\nafternoon showing me everything. By the next day, I found\\ntwo great properties with her help that have been accruing\\ninterest at 16 percent ever since. It took a day to read the\\nbook, a day to take action, an hour for lunch, and a day to\\nacquire two great deals.\\n• Take classes, read, and attend seminars. I search newspapers and\\nthe Internet for new and interesting classes, many of which are\\nfree or inexpensive. I also attend and pay for expensive\\nseminars on what I want to learn. I am wealthy and free from\\nneeding a job simply because of the courses I took. I have\\nfriends who did not take those classes who told me I was\\nwasting my money, and yet they’re still at the same job.\\n• Make lots of offers. When I want a piece of real estate, I look\\nat many properties and generally write an offer. If you don’t\\nknow what the right offer is, neither do I. That is the job of\\nthe real estate agent. They make the offers. I do as little work\\nas possible.\\nA friend wanted me to show her how to buy apartment houses.\\nSo one Saturday she, her agent, and I went and looked at six\\napartment houses. Four were dogs, but two were good. I said to write\\noffers on all six, offering half of what the owners asked for. She and the\\nagent nearly had heart attacks. They thought it was rude, and would\\noffend the sellers, but I really don’t think the agent wanted to work\\nthat hard. So they did nothing and went on looking for a better deal.\\nNo offers were ever made, and that person is still looking for the right\\ndeal at the right price. Well, you don’t know what the right price is until\\n168', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nyou have a second party who wants to deal. Most sellers ask too much.\\nIt is rare that a seller asks a price that is less than something is worth.\\nMoral of the story: Make offers. People who are not investors have no\\nidea what it feels like to try to sell something. I have had a piece of real\\nestate that I wanted to sell for months. I would have welcomed any offer.\\nThey could have offered me 10 pigs, and I would have been happy—\\nnot at the offer, but just because someone was interested. I would have\\ncountered, maybe for a pig farm in exchange. But that’s how the game\\nworks. The game of buying and selling is fun. Keep that in mind. It’s fun\\nand only a game. Make offers. Someone might say yes.\\nI always make offers with escape clauses. In real estate, I make an\\noffer with language that details “subject-to” contingencies, such as the\\napproval of a business partner. Never specify who the business\\npartner is. Most people don’t know that my partner is my cat. If they\\naccept the offer, and I don’t want the deal, I call home and speak to\\nmy cat. I make this ridiculous statement to illustrate how absurdly easy\\nand simple the game is. So many people make things too difficult and\\ntake it too seriously.\\n• Finding a good deal, the right business, the right people, the\\nright investors, or whatever is just like dating. You must go\\nto the market and talk to a lot of people, make a lot of offers,\\ncounteroffers, negotiate, reject, and accept. I know single\\npeople who sit at home and wait for the phone to ring, but it’s\\nbetter to go to the market, even if it’s only the supermarket.\\nSearch, offer, reject, negotiate, and accept are all parts of the\\nprocess of almost everything in life.\\n• Jog, walk, or drive a certain area once a month for 10 minutes.\\nI have found some of my best real estate investments doing\\nthis. I will jog a certain neighborhood for a year and look for\\nchange. For there to be profit in a deal, there must be two\\nelements: a bargain and change. There are lots of bargains, but\\nit’s change that turns a bargain into a profitable opportunity.\\nSo when I jog, I jog a neighborhood I might like to invest in.\\nIt is the repetition that causes me to notice slight differences.\\n169', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Chapter Nine: Here Are Some To Do’s\\nI notice real estate signs that are up for a long time. That\\nmeans the seller might be more agreeable to deal. I watch for\\nmoving trucks going in or out. I stop and talk to the drivers. I\\ntalk to the postal carriers. It’s amazing how much information\\nthey acquire about an area. I find a bad area, especially an\\narea that the news has scared everyone away from. I drive it for\\nsometimes a year waiting for signs of some thing changing for\\nthe better. I talk to retailers, especially new ones, and find out\\nwhy they’re moving in. It takes only a few minutes a month, and\\nI do it while doing something else, like exercising, or going to\\nand from the store.\\n• Shop for bargains in all markets. Consumers will always be\\npoor. When the supermarket has a sale, say on toilet paper, the\\nconsumer runs in and stocks up. But when the housing or stock\\nmarket has a sale, most often called a crash or correction, the same\\nconsumer often runs away from it. When the supermarket raises\\nits prices, the consumer shops somewhere else. But when housing\\nor the stock market raise their prices, the same consumer often\\nrushes in and starts buying. Always remember: Profits are made\\nin the buying, not in the selling.\\n• Look in the right places. A neighbor bought a condominium for\\n$100,000. I bought the identical condo next door for\\n$50,000. He told me he’s waiting for the price to go up. I told\\nhim that profit is made when you buy, not when you sell. He\\nshopped with a real estate broker who owns no property of her\\nown. I shopped at the foreclosure auction. I paid $500 for a\\nclass on how to do this.\\nMy neighbor thought that the $500 for a real estate investment\\nclass was too expensive. He said he could not afford the money,\\nor the time. So he waits for the price to go up.\\n170', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\n• Look for people who want to buy first. Then look for someone who\\nwants to sell. A friend was looking for a certain piece of land.\\nHe had the money but did not have the time. I found a large\\npiece of land, larger than what my friend wanted to buy, tied\\nit up with an option, called my friend, and he said he wanted\\na piece of it. So I sold the piece to him and then bought the\\nland. I kept the remaining land as mine for free. Moral of the\\nstory: Buy the pie, and cut it in pieces. Most people look for\\nwhat they can afford, so they look too small. They buy only\\na piece of the pie, so they end up paying more for less. Small\\nthinkers don’t get the big breaks. If you want to get richer,\\nthink big.\\n• Think big. Retailers love giving volume discounts, simply\\nbecause most business people love big spenders. So even if\\nyou’re small, you can always think big. When my company\\nwas in the market for computers, I called several friends and\\nasked them if they were ready to buy also. We then went to\\ndifferent dealers and negotiated a great deal because we wanted\\nto buy so many. I have done the same with stocks. Small\\npeople remain small because they think small, act alone, or\\ndon’t act all.\\n• Learn from history. All the big companies on the stock\\nexchange started out as small companies. Colonel Sanders did\\nnot get rich until after he lost everything in his 60s. Bill Gates\\nwas one of the richest men in the world before he was thirty.\\n• Action always beats inaction.\\nThese are just a few of the things I have done and continue to do\\nto recognize opportunities. The important words are “have done” and\\n“do.” As repeated many times throughout the book, you must take\\naction before you can receive the financial rewards. Act now!\\n171', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='nan', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='FINAL THOUGHTS\\nI would like to share some final thoughts with you.\\nThe main reason I wrote this book, and the reason it has remained\\na bestseller since 2000, was to share insights into how increased financial\\nintelligence can be used to solve many of life’s common problems. Without\\nfinancial training, we all too often use the standard formulas to get through\\nlife: Work hard, save, borrow, and pay excessive taxes. Today, more than\\never, we need better information.\\nI use the following story as an example of a financial problem that\\nconfronts many young families today. How do you afford a good\\neducation for your children and provide for your own retirement?\\nIt requires using financial intelligence instead of hard work.\\nA friend of mine was griping one day about how hard it was to\\nsave money for his four children’s college educations. He was putting\\n$300 away in a college fund each month and had so far accumulated\\nonly about $12,000. He had about 12 more years to save for college\\nsince his oldest child was then six years old.\\nAt the time, the real estate market in Phoenix was terrible. People\\nwere giving houses away. I suggested to my friend that he buy a house\\nwith some of the money in his college fund. The idea intrigued him,\\nand we began to discuss the possibility. His primary concern was that\\nhe did not have credit with the bank to buy another house since he\\nwas so over-extended. I assured him that there were other ways to\\nfinance a property rather than through the bank.\\nWe looked for a house for two weeks, a house that would fit all our\\ncriteria. There were plenty to choose from so shopping was fun. Finally,\\nwe found a three-bedroom, two-bath home in a prime neighborhood.\\nThe owner had been downsized and needed to sell that day because he\\n173', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Final Thoughts: Using Financial Intelligence\\nand his family were moving to California where another job waited.\\nThe owner wanted $102,000, but we offered only $79,000. He took\\nit immediately and agreed to carry back the loan with a 10 percent\\ndown payment. All my friend had to come up with was $7,900. As\\nsoon as the owner moved, my friend put the house up for rent. After all\\nexpenses were paid, including the mortgage, he put about $125 in his\\npocket each month.\\nHis plan was to keep the house for 12 years and let the mortgage\\nget paid down faster by applying the extra $125 to the principal each\\nmonth. We figured that in 12 years, a large portion of the mortgage\\nwould be paid off and he could possibly be clearing $800 a month by\\nthe time his first child went to college. He could also sell the house if it\\nhad appreciated in value.\\nThree years later, the real estate market greatly improved in\\nPhoenix and he was offered $156,000 for the same house by the\\ntenant who lived in it. Again, he asked me what I thought. I advised\\nthat he sell it, using a 1031 tax-deferred exchange.\\nSuddenly, he had nearly $80,000 to operate with. I called another\\nfriend in Austin, Texas, who then moved this tax-deferred capital gain\\ninto a mini-storage facility. Within three months, he began receiving\\nchecks for a little less than a $1,000 a month which he then poured\\nback into the college fund.\\nA couple of years later, the mini-warehouse sold, and he received\\na check for nearly $330,000 as proceeds from the sale. He rolled those\\nfunds into a new project that would now generate over $3,000 a\\nmonth in income, again, going into the college fund. He is now very\\nconfident that his goal will be met easily.\\nIt only took $7,900 to start and a little financial intelligence. His\\nchildren will be able to afford the education they want, and he will\\nthen use the underlying asset, wrapped in his legal entity, to pay for his\\nretirement. As a result of this successful investment strategy, he will be\\nable to retire early.\\nThank you for reading this book. I hope it has provided some\\ninsights into utilizing the power of money to work for you. Today, we\\n174', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nneed greater financial intelligence to simply survive. The idea that “it takes\\nmoney to make money” is the thinking of financially unsophisticated\\npeople. It does not mean that they’re not intelligent. They have simply not\\nlearned the science of money making money.\\nMoney is only an idea. If you want more money, simply change\\nyour thinking. Every self-made person started small with an idea, and\\nthen turned it into something big. The same applies to investing. It\\ntakes only a few dollars to start and grow it into something big. I meet\\nso many people who spend their lives chasing the big deal, or trying to\\namass a lot of money to get into a big deal, but to me that is foolish. Too\\noften I have seen unsophisticated investors put their large nest egg into\\none deal and lose most of it rapidly. They may have been good workers,\\nbut they were not good investors.\\nEducation and wisdom about money are important. Start early.\\nBuy a book. Go to a seminar. Practice. Start small. I turned $5,000 cash\\ninto a one-million-dollar asset producing $5,000 a month cash flow in\\nless than six years. But I started learning as a kid. I encourage you to\\nlearn, because it’s not that hard. In fact, it’s pretty easy once you get the\\nhang of it.\\nI think I have made my message clear. It’s what is in your head that\\ndetermines what is in your hands. Money is only an idea. There is a\\ngreat book called Think and Grow Rich. The title is not Work Hard\\nand Grow Rich. Learn to have money work hard for you, and your\\nlife will be easier and happier. Today, don’t play it safe. Play it smart.\\nThe Three Incomes\\nIn the world of accounting, there are three different types of income:\\n1. Ordinary earned\\n2. Portfolio\\n3. Passive\\n175', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Final Thoughts: Using Financial Intelligence\\nWhen my poor dad said to me, “Go to school, get good grades,\\nand find a safe secure job,” he was recommending I work for earned\\nincome. When my rich dad said, “The rich don’t work for money.\\nThey have their money work for them,” he was talking about passive\\nincome and portfolio income. Passive income, in most cases, is income\\nderived from real estate investments. Portfolio income is income\\nderived from paper assets such as stocks and bonds. Portfolio income\\nis the income that makes Bill Gates the richest man in the world, not\\nearned income.\\nRich dad used to say, “The key to becoming wealthy is the\\nability to convert earned income into passive income or portfolio\\nincome as quickly as possible.” He would say, “Taxes are highest on\\nearned income. The least-taxed income is passive income. That is\\nanother reason why you want your money working hard for you. The\\ngovernment taxes the income you work hard for more than the income\\nyour money works hard for.”\\nIn my second book, Rich Dad’s CASHFLOW Quadrant, I explain\\nthe four different types of people who make up the world of business.\\nThey are E (Employee), S (Self-employed), B (Business Owner), and\\nI (Investor). Most people go to school to learn to be an E or an S. The\\nCASHFLOW Quadrant is written about the core differences of these\\nfour types and how people can change their quadrant. In fact, most\\nof our products are created for people in the B and I quadrants.\\nIn Rich Dad’s Guide to Investing, book number three in the Rich\\nDad series, I go into more detail on the importance of converting\\nearned income into passive and portfolio income. Rich dad used to\\nsay, “All a real investor does is convert earned income into passive\\nand portfolio income. If you know what you’re doing, investing is not\\nrisky. It’s just common sense.”\\nThe Key to Financial Freedom\\nThe key to financial freedom and great wealth is a person’s ability to\\nconvert earned income into passive and/or portfolio income. My rich dad\\nspent a lot of time teaching Mike and me this skill. Having this ability is\\n176', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nthe reason my wife Kim and I are financially free, never needing to work\\nagain. We continue to work because we choose to. Today we own a real\\nestate investment company for passive income and participate in private\\nplacements and initial public offerings of stock for portfolio income.\\nWe also went back to work to build a financial-education company\\nso that we can continue to create and publish books and games. All of\\nour educational products are created to teach the same skills my rich\\ndad taught me, the skills of converting earned income into passive and\\nportfolio income.\\nThe games we create are important because they teach what books\\ncannot teach. For example, you could never learn to ride a bicycle by\\nonly reading a book. Our CASHFLOW games for adults and\\nCASHFLOW for Kids game are designed to teach players the basic\\ninvestment skills of converting earned income into passive and\\nportfolio income. They also teach the principles of accounting and\\nfinancial literacy. These games are the only educational products in\\nthe world that teach people all of\\nYou can play these skills simultaneously.\\nCASHFLOW Classic CASHFLOW 202 is the advanced\\non the web at version of CASHFLOW 101 and\\nwww.richdad.com requires the game board from 101, as\\nand learn to convert well as a full understanding of 101,\\nearned income into before it can be played. CASHFLOW\\npassive and/or 101 and CASHFLOW for Kids\\nportfolio income teach the principles of fundamental\\ninvesting. CASHFLOW 202 teaches the\\nprinciples of technical investing. Technical investing involves advanced\\ntrading techniques such as short selling, call options, put options, and\\nstraddles. A person who understands these advanced techniques is able\\nto make money when the market goes up, as well as when the market\\ncomes down. As my rich dad would say, “A real investor makes money\\nin an up market and a down market. That is why they make so much\\nmoney.” One of the reasons they make more money is simply because\\nthey have more self-confidence. Rich dad would say, “They have more\\n177', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Final Thoughts: Using Financial Intelligence\\nself-confidence because they are less afraid of losing.” In other words, the\\naverage investor does not make as much money because they are so afraid\\nof losing money. The average investor does not know how to protect\\nthemselves from losses, and that is what CASHFLOW 202 teaches.\\nAverage investors think investing is risky because they have not\\nbeen formally trained to be professional investors. As Warren Buffett,\\nAmerica’s richest investor says, “Risk comes from not knowing what\\nyou’re doing.” My board games teach the simple basics of fundamental\\ninvesting and technical investing while people are having fun.\\nI occasionally hear someone say, “Your educational games are\\nexpensive,” which poses the question of ROI, the return on investment,\\nor the value returned for the price paid. I nod my head and reply, “Yes,\\nthey may be expensive, especially when compared to entertainment board\\ngames. But my games are not as expensive as a college education, working\\nhard all your life for earned income, paying excessive taxes, and then\\nliving in terror of losing all of your money in the investment markets.”\\nWhen someone walks away mumbling about the price, I can hear\\nmy rich dad saying, “If you want to be rich, you must know what kind\\nof income to work hard for, how to keep it, and how to protect it from\\nloss. That is the key to great wealth.” Rich dad would also say, “If you\\ndo not understand the differences in those three incomes and do not\\nlearn the skills on how to acquire and protect those incomes, you will\\nprobably spend your life earning less than you could and working harder\\nthan you should.”\\nMy poor dad thought a good education, a good job, and years of\\nhard work were all you needed to be successful. My rich dad also thought\\na good education was important. But to him it was also important\\nthat Mike and I know the differences in the three incomes and what\\nkind of income to work hard for. To him, that was basic financial\\neducation. Knowing the differences in the three incomes and learning\\nthe investment skills of how to acquire the different incomes is basic\\neducation for anyone who strives to acquire great wealth and achieve\\nfinancial freedom—a special kind of freedom that only a few will ever\\nknow. As rich dad states in lesson number one, “The rich do not work\\nfor money. They know how to have money work hard for them.”\\n178', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad\\nRich dad said, “Ordinary earned income is money you work for,\\nand passive and portfolio income is money working for you.” Knowing\\nthat little difference has been significant in my life. Or, as Robert Frost\\nends his poem, “And that has made all the difference.”\\nTake Action!\\nAll of you were given two great gifts: your mind and your time.\\nIt is up to you to do what you please with both. With each dollar bill\\nthat enters your hand, you, and only you, have the power to determine\\nyour destiny. Spend it foolishly, and you choose to be poor. Spend it\\non liabilities, and you join the middle class. Invest it in your mind and\\nlearn how to acquire assets, and you will be choosing wealth as your\\ngoal and your future. The choice is yours, and only yours. Every day\\nwith every dollar, you decide to be rich, poor, or middle class.\\nChoose to share this knowledge with your children, and you\\nchoose to prepare them for the world that awaits.

Fourteen\\nyears ago, Robert Kiyosaki challenged conventional wisdom with his\\nbold statement that “your house is not an asset.” His contrarian views on\\nmoney and investing were met with skepticism, criticism, and outrage.\\nIn 2002, Robert’s book, Rich Dad’s Prophecy, advised that we prepare for\\nan upcoming financial market crash. In 2006, Robert joined forces with\\nDonald Trump to write Why We Want You To Be Rich, a book inspired by\\ntheir concern for the shrinking middle class in America.\\nRobert continues to be a passionate advocate for the importance and\\npower of financial education. Today, in the wake of the subprime fiasco,\\nrecord home foreclosures, and a global economic meltdown that is\\nstill raging, his words seem not only prophetic, but enlightened. Many\\nskeptics have become believers.\\nIn preparing the 2011 edition of Rich Dad’s CASHFLOW Quadrant,\\nRobert realized two things: that his message and teachings have withstood\\nthe test of time, and that the investment landscape, the world in which\\ninvestors operate, has changed dramatically.

If it\\nsounded exciting and glamorous, I wanted to do it. I wanted to be a\\nmarine biologist, an astronaut, a Marine, a ship’s officer, a pilot, and\\na professional football player.\\nI was fortunate enough to achieve three of those goals: a Marine\\nCorps officer, a ship’s officer, and a pilot.\\nI knew I did not want to become a teacher, a writer, or an accountant.\\nI did not want to be a teacher because I did not like school. I did not want\\nto be a writer because I failed English twice. And I dropped out of my\\nMBA program because I could not stand accounting.\\nIronically, now that I have grown up, I have become everything\\nI never wanted to become. Although I disliked school, today I own an\\neducation company. I personally teach around the world because I love\\nteaching. Although I failed English twice because I could not write,\\ntoday I am best known as an author. My book, Rich Dad Poor Dad, was\\non the New York Times best-sellers list for over seven years and is one of\\nthe top three best-selling books in the United States. The only books\\nahead of it are The Joy of Sex and The Road Less Traveled. Adding one\\nmore irony, Rich Dad Poor Dad and my CASHFLOW® board game are\\na book and a game about accounting, another subject I struggled with.\\nSo what does this have to do with the question: “What is your goal\\nin life?”\\nxv\", metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Preface\\nThe answer is found in the simple, yet profound, statement by\\na Vietnamese monk, Thich Naht Hahn: “The path is the goal.” In\\nother words, finding your path in life is your goal in life. Your path is\\nnot your profession, how much money you make, your title, or your\\nsuccesses and failures.\\nFinding your path means finding out what you were put here on\\nthis earth to do. What is your life’s purpose? Why were you given this\\ngift called life? And what is the gift you give back to life?\\nLooking back, I know going to school was not about finding my\\nlife’s path. I spent four years in military school, studying and training\\nto be a ship’s officer. If I had made a career sailing for Standard Oil\\non their oil tankers, I would never have found my life’s path. If I had\\nstayed in the Marines or had gone to fly for the airlines, I would never\\nhave found my life’s path.\\nHad I continued on as a ship’s officer or become an airline pilot,\\nI would never have become an international best-selling author,\\nbeen a guest on the Oprah show, written a book with Donald\\nTrump, or started an international education company that teaches\\nentrepreneurship and investing throughout the world.\\nFinding Your Path\\nThis CASHFLOW Quadrant book is important because it is about\\nfinding your path in life. As you know, most people are programmed\\nearly in life to “Go to school and get a job.” School is about finding a\\njob in the E or S quadrant. It is not about finding your life’s path.\\nI realize there are people who know exactly what they are going to\\ndo early in life. They grow up knowing they are going to be a doctor,\\nlawyer, musician, golfer or actor. We have all heard about child\\nprodigies, kids with exceptional talents. Yet you may notice, these are\\nprofessions, not necessarily a life’s path.\\nxvi', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='CASHFLOW Quadrant\\nSo How Does One Find Their Path in Life?\\nMy answer is: I wish I knew. If I could wave my magic wand and\\nyour life’s path would magically appear, I would.\\nSince I do not have a magic wand nor can I tell you what to do,\\nthe best thing I can do is tell you what I did. And what I did was trust\\nmy intuition, my heart, and my guts. For example, in 1973, returning\\nfrom the war, when my poor dad suggested I go back to school, get my\\nhigher degrees, and work for the government, my brain went numb,\\nmy heart went heavy and my gut said, “No way.”\\nWhen he suggested I get my old job back with Standard Oil or fly\\nfor the airlines, again my mind, heart, and gut said no. I knew I was\\nthrough sailing and flying, although they were great professions and\\nthe pay was pretty good.\\nIn 1973 at the age of 26, I was growing up. I had followed my\\nparent’s advice and gone to school, received my college degree, and had\\ntwo professions: a license to be a ship’s officer and a license to fly. The\\nproblem was, they were professions and the dreams of a child.\\nAt the age of 26, I was old enough to know that education is a process.\\nFor example, when I wanted to be a ship’s officer, I went to a school that\\nturned out ships’ officers. And when I wanted to learn to fly, I went to\\nNavy flight school, a two-year process that turns non-pilots into pilots.\\nI was cautious about my next educational process. I wanted to know what\\nI was going to become before I started my next educational process.\\nTraditional schools had been good to me. I had achieved my\\nchildhood professions. Reaching adulthood was confusing because\\nthere were no signs saying, “This is the way.” I knew what I didn’t want\\nto do, but I did not know what I wanted to do.\\nIt would have been simple if all I wanted was a new profession.\\nIf I had wanted to be a medical doctor, I would have gone to medical\\nschool. If I had wanted to be a lawyer, I would have gone to law\\nschool. But I knew there was more to life than just going to school to\\ngain another professional credential.\\nI did not realize it at the time, but at 26 years of age, I was now\\nlooking for my path in life, not my next profession.\\nxvii', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Preface\\nA Different Education\\nIn 1973, in my last year of active duty flying for the Marine\\nCorps when I was stationed near home in Hawaii, I knew I wanted\\nto follow in my rich dad’s footsteps. While in the Marines, I signed\\nup for real estate courses and business courses on the weekends,\\npreparing to become an entrepreneur in the B and I quadrants.\\nAt the same time, upon a friend’s recommendation of a friend,\\nI signed up for a personal-development course, hoping to find out\\nwho I really was. A personal-development course is non-traditional\\neducation because I was not taking it for credits or grades. I did not\\nknow what I was going to learn, as I did when I signed up for real\\nestate courses. All I knew was that it was time to take courses to find\\nout about me.\\nIn my first weekend course, the instructor drew this simple\\ndiagram on the flip chart:\\nPHYSICAL\\nMENTAL\\nEMOTIONAL\\nSPIRITUAL\\nxviii', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='CASHFLOW Quadrant\\nWith the diagram complete, the instructor turned and said,\\n“To develop into a whole human being, we need mental, physical,\\nemotional, and spiritual education.”\\nListening to her explanation, it was clear to me that traditional schools\\nwere primarily about developing students mentally. That is why so many\\nstudents who do well in school, do not do well in real life, especially in the\\nworld of money.\\nAs the course progressed over the weekend, I discovered why I disliked\\nschool. I realized that I loved learning, but hated school.\\nTraditional education was a great environment for the “A”\\nstudents, but it was not the environment for me. Traditional education\\nwas crushing my spirit, trying to motivate me with the emotion of\\nfear: the fear of making mistakes, the fear of failing, and the fear of not\\ngetting a job. They were programming me to be an employee in the E\\nor S quadrant. I realized that traditional education is not the place for\\na person who wants to be an entrepreneur in the B and I quadrants.\\nThis may be why so many entrepreneurs never finish school—\\nentrepreneurs like Thomas Edison, founder of General Electric; Henry\\nFord, founder of Ford Motor Company; Steve Jobs, founder of Apple;\\nBill Gates, founder of Microsoft; Walt Disney, founder of Disneyland;\\nand Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook.\\nAs the day went on and the instructor went deeper and deeper into\\nthese four types of personal development, I realized I had spent most\\nof my life in very harsh educational environments. After four years at\\nan all-male military academy and five years as a Marine pilot, I was\\npretty strong mentally and physically. As a Marine pilot, I was strong\\nemotionally and spiritually, but all on the macho-male development\\nside. I had no gentle side, no female energy. After all, I was trained to\\nbe Marine Corps officer, emotionally calm under pressure, prepared to\\nkill, and spiritually prepared to die for my country.\\nIf you ever saw the movie Top Gun starring Tom Cruise, you get\\na glimpse into the masculine world and bravado of military pilots. I\\nloved that world. I was good in that world. It was a modern-day world\\nof knights and warriors. It was not a world for wimps.\\nxix', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Preface\\nIn the seminar, I went into my emotions and briefly touched my\\nspirit. I cried a lot because I had a lot to cry about. I had done and\\nseen things no one should ever be asked to do. During the seminar,\\nI hugged a man, something I had never done before, not even with\\nmy father.\\nOn Sunday night, it was difficult leaving this self-development\\nworkshop. The seminar had been a gentle, loving, honest environment.\\nMonday morning was a shock to once again be surrounded by young\\negotistical pilots, dedicated to flying, killing and dying for country.\\nAfter that weekend seminar, I knew it was time to change. I knew\\ndeveloping myself emotionally and spiritually to become a kinder,\\ngentler, and more compassionate person would be the hardest thing\\nI could do. It went against all my years at the military academy and\\nflight school.\\nI never returned to traditional education again. I had no desire\\nto study for grades, degrees, promotions, or credentials again. From\\nthen on, if I did attend a course or school, I went to learn, to become\\na better person. I was no longer in the paper chase of grades, degrees,\\nand credentials.\\nGrowing up in a family of teachers, your grades, the high school\\nand college you graduated from, and your advanced degrees were\\neverything. Like the medals and ribbons on a Marine pilot’s chest,\\nadvanced degrees and brand-name schools were the status and the\\nstripes that educators wore on their sleeves. In their minds, people\\nwho did not finish high school were the unwashed, the lost souls of\\nlife. Those with master’s degrees looked down on those with only\\nbachelor degrees. Those with a PhD were held in reverence. At the\\nage of 26, I knew I would never return to that world.\\nEditor’s Note: In 2009, Robert received an honorary PhD in\\nentrepreneurship from prestigious San Ignacio de Loyola in\\nLima, Peru. The few other recipients of this award are political\\nleaders, such as the former President of Spain.\\nxx', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='CASHFLOW Quadrant\\nFinding My Path\\nI know some of you are now asking: Why is he spending so much\\ntime talking about non-traditional education courses?\\nThe reason is, that first personal-development seminar rekindled\\nmy love of learning, but not the type of learning that is taught in\\nschool. Once that seminar was over, I became a seminar junkie, going\\nfrom seminar to seminar, finding out more about the connection\\nbetween my body, my mind, my emotions, and my spirit.\\nThe more I studied, the more curious about traditional education\\nI became. I began to ask questions such as:\\n• Why do so many kids hate school?\\n• Why do so few kids like school?\\n• Why are many highly educated people not successful\\nin the real world?\\n• Does school prepare you for the real world?\\n• Why did I hate school but love learning?\\n• Why are most schoolteachers poor?\\n• Why do schools teach us little about money?\\nThose questions led me to become a student of education outside\\nthe hallowed walls of the school system. The more I studied, the more\\nI understood why I did not like school and why schools failed to serve\\nmost of its students, even the “A” students.\\nMy curiosity touched my spirit, and I became an entrepreneur\\nin education. If not for this curiosity, I might never have become an\\nauthor and a developer of financial-education games. My spiritual\\neducation led me to my path in life.\\nIt seems that our paths in life are not found in our minds. Our\\npath in life is to find out what is in our hearts.\\nThis does not mean a person cannot find their path in traditional\\neducation. I am sure many do. I am just saying that I doubt I would\\nhave found my path in traditional school.\\nxxi', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Preface\\nWhy Is a Path Important?\\nWe all know people who make a lot of money, but hate their\\nwork. We also know people who do not make a lot of money and\\nhate their work. And we all know people who just work for money.\\nA classmate of mine from the Merchant Marine Academy also\\nrealized he did not want to spend his life at sea. Rather than sail for\\nthe rest of his life, he went to law school after graduation, spending\\nthree more years becoming a lawyer and entering private practice in\\nthe S quadrant.\\nHe died in his early fifties. He had become a very successful,\\nunhappy lawyer. Like me, he had two professions by the time he was\\n26. Although he hated being a lawyer, he continued being a lawyer\\nbecause he had a family, kids, a mortgage, and bills to pay.\\nA year before he died, I met him at a class reunion in New York.\\nHe was a bitter man. “All I do is sweep up behind rich guys like you.\\nThey pay me nothing. I hate what I do and who I work for.”\\n“Why don’t you do something else?” I asked.\\n“I can’t afford to stop working. My first child is entering college.”\\nHe died of a heart attack before she graduated.\\nHe made a lot of money via his professional training, but he was\\nemotionally angry, spiritually dead, and soon his body followed.\\nI realize this is an extreme example. Most people do not hate what\\nthey do as much as my friend did. Yet it illustrates the problem when\\na person is trapped in a profession and unable to find their path.\\nTo me, this is the shortcoming of traditional education. Millions\\nof people leave school, only to be trapped in jobs they do not like.\\nThey know something is missing in life. Many people are also trapped\\nfinancially, earning just enough to survive, wanting to earn more but\\nnot knowing what to do.\\nWithout awareness of the other quadrants, many people go back\\nto school and look for new professions or pay raises in the E or S\\nquadrant, unaware of the world of the B and I quadrants.\\nxxii', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='CASHFLOW Quadrant\\nMy Reason for Becoming a Teacher\\nMy primary reason for becoming a teacher in the B quadrant was a\\ndesire to provide financial education. I wanted to make this education\\navailable to anyone who wanted to learn, regardless of how much money\\nthey had or what their grade-point averages were. That is why The Rich\\nDad Company started with the CASHFLOW game. This game can teach\\nin places I could never go. The beauty of the game is that it was designed\\nto have people teach people. There is no need for an expensive teacher\\nor classroom. The CASHFLOW game is now translated into over sixteen\\nlanguages, reaching millions of people all over the world.\\nToday, The Rich Dad Company offers financial-education courses as\\nwell as the services of coaches and mentors to support a person’s financial\\neducation. Our programs are especially important for anyone wanting to\\nevolve out of the E and S quadrants into the B and I quadrants.\\nThere is no guarantee that everyone will make it to the B and I\\nquadrants, yet they will know how to access those quadrants if they want to.\\nChange Is Not Easy\\nFor me, changing quadrants was not easy. It was hard work\\nmentally, but more so emotionally and spiritually. Growing up in a\\nfamily of highly educated employees in the E quadrant, I carried their\\nvalues of education, job security, benefits, and a government pension.\\nIn many ways, my family values made my transition difficult. I had to\\nshut out their warnings, concerns, and criticisms about becoming an\\nentrepreneur and investor. Some of their values I had to discount were:\\n• “But you have to have a job.”\\n• “You’re taking too many risks.”\\n• “What if you fail?”\\n• “Just go back to school and get your masters degree.”\\n• “Become a doctor. They make a lot of money.”\\n• “The rich are greedy.”\\nxxiii', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Preface\\n• “Why is money so important to you?”\\n• “Money won’t make you happy.”\\n• “Just live below your means.”\\n• “Play it safe. Don’t go for your dreams.”\\nDiet and Exercise\\nI mention emotional and spiritual development because that is\\nwhat it takes to make a permanent change in life. For example, it\\nrarely works to tell an overweight person, “Just eat less and exercise\\nmore.” Diet and exercise may make sense mentally, but most people\\nwho are overweight do not eat because they are hungry. They eat to\\nfeed an emptiness in their emotions and their soul. When a person\\ngoes on a diet-and-exercise program, they are only working on their\\nmind and their body. Without emotional development and spiritual\\nstrength, the overweight person may go on a diet for six months\\nand lose a ton of weight, only to put even more weight back on later.\\nThe same is true for changing quadrants. Saying to yourself,\\n“I’m going to become an entrepreneur in the B quadrant,” is as futile\\nas a chain smoker saying, “Tomorrow I’m going to quit smoking.”\\nSmoking is a physical addiction caused by emotional and spiritual\\nchallenges. Without emotional and spiritual support, the smoker\\nwill always be a smoker. The same is true for an alcoholic, a sex\\naddict, or a chronic shopper. Most addictions are attempts to find\\nhappiness in people’s souls.\\nThis is why my company offers courses for the mind and body,\\nbut also coaches and mentors to support the emotional and spiritual\\ntransitions.\\nA few people are able to make the journey alone, but I was not\\none of them. If not for a coach like my rich dad and the support\\nof my wife Kim, I would not have made it. There were so many\\ntimes I wanted to quit and give up. If not for Kim and my rich dad,\\nI would have quit.\\nxxiv', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='CASHFLOW Quadrant\\nWhy “A” Students Fail\\nLooking at the diagram again, it is easy to see why so many “A”\\nstudents fail in the world of money.\\nBODY\\nMIND\\nEMOTION\\nSPIRIT\\nA person may be highly educated mentally, but if they are not\\neducated emotionally, their fear will often stop their body from doing\\nwhat it must do. That is why so many “A” students get stuck in “analysis\\nparalysis,” studying every little detail, but failing to do anything.\\nThis “analysis paralysis” is caused by our educational system\\npunishing students for making mistakes. If you think about it,\\n“A” students are “A” students simply because they made the fewest\\nmistakes. The problem with that emotional psychosis is that, in the\\nreal world, people who take action are the ones who make the most\\nmistakes and learn from them to win in the game of life.\\nJust look at Presidents Clinton and Bush. Clinton could not admit\\nhe had sex and Bush could not recall any mistakes he made during his\\npresidency. Making mistakes is human, but lying about your mistakes\\nis criminal, a criminal act known as perjury.\\nxxv', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Preface\\nWhen criticized for making 1,014 mistakes before creating the\\nelectric light bulb, Thomas Edison said, “I did not fail 1,014 times.\\nI successfully found out what did not work 1,014 times.”\\nIn other words, the reason so many people fail to achieve success\\nis because they fail to fail enough times.\\nLooking at the diagram again,\\nBODY\\nMIND\\nEMOTION\\nSPIRIT\\none of the reasons so many people cling to job security is because they\\nlack emotional education. They let fear stop them.\\nOne of the best things about military school and the Marine\\nCorps is that these organizations spend a lot of time developing\\nyoung men and women spiritually, emotionally, mentally, and\\nphysically. Although it was a tough education, it was a complete\\neducation, preparing us to do a nasty job.\\nThe reason I created the CASHFLOW game is because the game\\neducates the whole person. The game is a better teaching tool than\\nreading or lecture, simply because the game involves the body, mind,\\nemotions, and spirit of the player.\\nThe game is designed for players to make as many mistakes as\\npossible with play money, and then learn from those mistakes. To me,\\nthis is a more humane way to learn about money.\\nxxvi', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='CASHFLOW Quadrant\\nThe Path Is the Goal\\nToday, there are thousands of CASHFLOW clubs all over the world.\\nOne reason why CASHFLOW clubs are important is because they are\\na shelter from the storm, a way station on the path of life. By joining\\na CASHFLOW club, you get to meet people like you, people who are\\ncommitted to making changes, not just talking about change.\\nUnlike school, there is not a requirement of past academic success.\\nAll that is asked is a sincere desire to learn and make changes.

We\\nall change and evolve at different rates of speed so you are encouraged to\\ngo at your own speed.\\nAfter playing the game with others a few times, you will have a\\nbetter idea of what your next step should be and which of the four asset\\nclasses (business, real estate, paper assets, or commodities) is best for you.\\nIn Conclusion\\nFinding one’s path is not necessarily easy. Even today, I do not\\nreally know if I am on my path or not. As you know, we all get lost at\\ntimes, and it is not always easy to find our way back.\\nIf you feel you are not in the right quadrant for you, or you are not\\non your life’s path, I encourage you to search your heart and find your\\npath in life. You may know it is time to change if you are saying things\\nlike the following statements:\\n• “I’m working with dead people.”\\n• “I love what I do, but I wish I could make more money.”\\n• “I can’t wait for the weekend.”\\n• “I want to do my own thing.”\\n• “Is it quitting time yet?”\\nxxvii', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Preface\\nMy sister is a Buddhist nun.

It was his way of explaining the\\ndifference between the left side of the CASHFLOW Quadrant, the E and\\nS quadrants, and the right side, or the B and I quadrants. The story goes\\nlike this:\\n4', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='CASHFLOW Quadrant\\n“Once upon a time there was this quaint little village. It was a great\\nplace to live except for one problem. The village had no water unless it\\nrained. To solve this problem once and for all, the village elders asked\\ncontractors to submit bids to deliver water to the village on a daily basis.\\nTwo people volunteered to take on the task, and the elders awarded the\\ncontract to both of them. They felt that a little competition would keep\\nprices low and ensure a backup supply of water.\\n“The first person who won the contract, Ed, immediately ran out,\\nbought two galvanized steel buckets and began running back and forth\\nto the lake which was a mile away. He immediately began making\\nmoney as he labored morning to dusk, hauling water from the lake with\\nhis two buckets. He would empty them into the large concrete holding\\ntank the village had built. Each morning he had to get up before the rest\\nof the village awoke to make sure there was enough water for the people.\\nIt was hard work, but he was very happy to be making money and for\\nhaving one of the two exclusive contracts for this business.\\n“The second winning contractor, Bill, disappeared for a while.\\nHe wasn’t seen for months, which made Ed very happy, since he had\\nno competition.\\n“Instead of buying two buckets to compete with Ed, Bill wrote a\\nbusiness plan, created a corporation, found four investors, employed\\na president to do the work, and returned six months later with a\\nconstruction crew. Within a year, his team had built a large-volume\\nstainless-steel pipeline which connected the village to the lake.\\n“At the grand-opening celebration, Bill announced that his\\nwater was cleaner than Ed’s water. Bill knew that the villagers had\\ncomplained about the water’s lack of cleanliness. Bill also announced\\nthat he could supply the village with water 24 hours a day, 7 days a\\nweek. Ed could only deliver water on weekdays because he didn’t want\\nto work on weekends. Then Bill announced that he would charge\\n75 percent less than Ed did for this higher-quality, more-reliable water.\\nThe villagers cheered and immediately ran for the faucet at the end\\nof Bill’s pipeline.\\n5', metadata={'source': 'book3'}), Document(page_content='Introduction\\n“In order to compete, Ed immediately lowered his rates by\\n75 percent, bought two more buckets, added covers to his buckets\\nand began hauling four buckets each trip. In order to provide better\\nservice, he hired his two sons to give him a hand on the night shift\\nand on weekends. When his boys went off to college, he said to them,\\n‘Hurry back because someday this business will belong to you.’\\n“For some reason, his two sons never returned. Eventually, Ed had\\nemployees and union problems. The union demanded higher wages\\nand better benefits and wanted its members to only haul one bucket\\nat a time.\\n“Meanwhile, Bill realized that if this village needed water, then\\nother villages must need water too. He rewrote his business plan and\\nwent off to sell his high-speed, high-volume, low-cost, clean-water\\ndelivery system to villages throughout the world. He only makes a\\npenny per bucket of water delivered, but he delivers billions of\\nbuckets of water every day. Whether he works or not, billions of\\npeople consume billions of buckets of water, and all that money pours\\ninto his bank account. Bill developed a pipeline to deliver money to\\nhimself, as well as water to the villages.\\n“Bill lived happily ever after. Ed worked hard for the rest of his\\nlife and had financial problems forever after. The end.”\\nThat story about Bill and Ed has guided me for years. It has\\nassisted me in my life’s decision-making process. I often ask myself:\\n“Am I building a pipeline or hauling buckets?”\\n“Am I working hard, or am I working smart?”\\nAnd the answers to those questions have made me financially free.\\nThat is what this book is about.

One, financial outcomes are driven by luck, independent of\\nintelligence and effort. That’s true to some extent, and this book will discuss\\nit in further detail. Or, two (and I think more common), that financial success\\nis not a hard science.

Physics isn’t controversial. It’s guided by laws. Finance is\\ndifferent. It’s guided by people’s behaviors. And how I behave might make\\nsense to me but look crazy to you.\\nThe more I studied and wrote about the financial crisis, the more I realized\\nthat you could understand it better through the lenses of psychology and\\nhistory, not finance.\\nTo grasp why people bury themselves in debt you don’t need to study interest\\nrates; you need to study the history of greed, insecurity, and optimism. To get\\nwhy investors sell out at the bottom of a bear market you don’t need to study\\nthe math of expected future returns; you need to think about the agony of\\nlooking at your family and wondering if your investments are imperiling their\\nfuture.\\nI love Voltaire’s observation that “History never repeats itself; man always', metadata={'source': 'book4'}), Document(page_content='does.” It applies so well to how we behave with money.\\nIn 2018, I wrote a report outlining 20 of the most important flaws, biases, and\\ncauses of bad behavior I’ve seen affect people when dealing with money.

They do play a role in the body’s road to recovery. We now have\\nbetter, more scientific evidence of fever’s usefulness in fighting infection. A\\none-degree increase in body temperature has been shown to slow the\\nreplication rate of some viruses by a factor of 200. “Numerous investigators\\nhave identified a better outcome among patients who displayed fever,” one\\nNIH paper writes.³⁴ The Seattle Children’s Hospital includes a section on its\\nwebsite to educate parents who may panic at the slightest rise in their child’s\\ntemperature: “Fevers turn on the body’s immune system.

The formulas presented in the book were appealing to me, because\\nthey were literally step-by-step instructions on how to get rich. Just follow\\nthe instructions. It seemed so easy.\\nBut something becomes clear when you try applying some of these formulas:\\nfew of them actually work.\\nGraham advocated purchasing stocks trading for less than their net working\\nassets—basically cash in the bank minus all debts. This sounds great, but few\\nstocks actually trade that cheaply anymore—other than, say, a penny stock', metadata={'source': 'book4'}), Document(page_content='accused of accounting fraud.\\nOne of Graham’s criteria instructs conservative investors to avoid stocks\\ntrading for more than 1.5 times book value. If you followed this rule over the\\nlast decade you would have owned almost nothing but insurance and bank\\nstocks. There is no world where that is OK.\\nThe Intelligent Investor is one of the greatest investing books of all time. But I\\ndon’t know a single investor who has done well implementing Graham’s\\npublished formulas. The book is full of wisdom—perhaps more than any\\nother investment book ever published. But as a how-to guide, it’s\\nquestionable at best.\\nWhat happened? Was Graham a showman who sounded good but whose\\nadvice didn’t work? Not at all. He was a wildly successful investor himself.\\nBut he was practical. And he was a true contrarian. He wasn’t so wedded to\\ninvesting ideas that he’d stick with them when too many other investors\\ncaught onto those theories, making them so popular as to render their\\npotential useless. Jason Zweig—who annotated a later version of Graham’s\\nbook—once wrote:\\nGraham was constantly experimenting and retesting his assumptions and\\nseeking out what works—not what worked yesterday but what works today.\\nIn each revised edition of The Intelligent Investor, Graham discarded the\\nformulas he presented in the previous edition and replaced them with new\\nones, declaring, in a sense, that “those do not work anymore, or they do not\\nwork as well as they used to; these are the formulas that seem to work better\\nnow.”\\nOne of the common criticisms made of Graham is that all the formulas in the\\n1972 edition are antiquated. The only proper response to this criticism is to\\nsay: “Of course they are! They are the ones he used to replace the formulas in\\nthe 1965 edition, which replaced the formulas in the 1954 edition, which, in\\nturn, replaced the ones from the 1949 edition, which were used to augment\\nthe original formulas that he presented in Security Analysis in 1934.”', metadata={'source': 'book4'}), Document(page_content='Graham died in 1976.

He\\nanswered:\\nIn general, no. I am no longer an advocate of elaborate techniques of security\\nanalysis in order to find superior value opportunities. This was a rewarding\\nactivity, say, 40 years ago, when our textbook was first published. But the\\nsituation has changed a great deal since then.⁴¹\\nWhat changed was: Competition grew as opportunities became well known;\\ntechnology made information more accessible; and industries changed as the\\neconomy shifted from industrial to technology sectors, which have different\\nbusiness cycles and capital uses.\\nThings changed.\\nAn interesting quirk of investing history is that the further back you look, the\\nmore likely you are to be examining a world that no longer applies to today.\\nMany investors and economists take comfort in knowing their forecasts are\\nbacked up by decades, even centuries, of data. But since economies evolve,\\nrecent history is often the best guide to the future, because it’s more likely to\\ninclude important conditions that are relevant to the future.\\nThere’s a common phrase in investing, usually used mockingly, that “It’s\\ndifferent this time.” If you need to rebut someone who’s predicting the future\\nwon’t perfectly mirror the past, say, “Oh, so you think it’s different this\\ntime?” and drop the mic.

We\\nmust make sure that we have enough money to withstand any swings of bad\\nluck.\\nLet’s assume you have roughly a 2 percent edge over the casino.

A rule of thumb\\nis that you should have at least a hundred basic units. Assuming you start\\nwith ten thousand dollars, you could comfortably play a hundred-dollar unit.\\nHistory is littered with good ideas taken too far, which are indistinguishable\\nfrom bad ideas. The wisdom in having room for error is acknowledging that\\nuncertainty, randomness, and chance—“unknowns”—are an ever-present part\\nof life. The only way to deal with them is by increasing the gap between what\\nyou think will happen and what can happen while still leaving you capable of\\nfighting another day.\\nBenjamin Graham is known for his concept of margin of safety. He wrote\\nabout it extensively and in mathematical detail. But my favorite summary of\\nthe theory came when he mentioned in an interview that “the purpose of the', metadata={'source': 'book4'}), Document(page_content='margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary.”\\nIt’s hard to overstate how much power lies in that simple statement.\\nMargin of safety—you can also call it room for error or redundancy—is the\\nonly effective way to safely navigate a world that is governed by odds, not\\ncertainties. And almost everything related to money exists in that kind of\\nworld.\\nForecasting with precision is hard. This is obvious to the card counter,\\nbecause no one could possibly know where a particular card lies in a shuffled\\ndeck. It’s less obvious to someone asking, “What will the average annual\\nreturn of the stock market be over the next 10 years?” or “On what date will I\\nbe able to retire?” But they are fundamentally the same. The best we can do is\\nthink about odds.\\nGraham’s margin of safety is a simple suggestion that we don’t need to view\\nthe world in front of us as black or white, predictable or a crapshoot. The\\ngrey area—pursuing things where a range of potential outcomes are\\nacceptable—is the smart way to proceed.\\nBut people underestimate the need for room for error in almost everything\\nthey do that involves money. Stock analysts give their clients price targets,\\nnot price ranges. Economic forecasters predict things with precise figures;\\nrarely broad probabilities. The pundit who speaks in unshakable certainties\\nwill gain a larger following than the one who says “We can’t know for sure,”\\nand speaks in probabilities.⁴²\\nWe do this in all kinds of financial endeavors, especially those related to our\\nown decisions.

The second is that you’re therefore doing', metadata={'source': 'book4'}), Document(page_content='yourself harm by not taking actions that fully exploit an accurate view of that\\nfuture coming true.\\nBut room for error is underappreciated and misunderstood. It’s often viewed\\nas a conservative hedge, used by those who don’t want to take much risk or\\naren’t confident in their views. But when used appropriately, it’s quite the\\nopposite.\\nRoom for error lets you endure a range of potential outcomes, and endurance\\nlets you stick around long enough to let the odds of benefiting from a low-\\nprobability outcome fall in your favor. The biggest gains occur infrequently,\\neither because they don’t happen often or because they take time to\\ncompound. So the person with enough room for error in part of their strategy\\n(cash) to let them endure hardship in another (stocks) has an edge over the\\nperson who gets wiped out, game over, insert more tokens, when they’re\\nwrong.\\nBill Gates understood this well. When Microsoft was a young company, he\\nsaid he “came up with this incredibly conservative approach that I wanted to\\nhave enough money in the bank to pay a year’s worth of payroll even if we\\ndidn’t get any payments coming in.” Warren Buffett expressed a similar idea\\nwhen he told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in 2008: “I have pledged—to\\nyou, the rating agencies and myself—to always run Berkshire with more than\\nample cash ... When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for\\nthe chance of extra profits.”⁴⁴\\nThere are a few specific places for investors to think about room for error.\\nOne is volatility.

They’re not\\ngood at modeling how you’ll feel when you tuck your kids in at night\\nwondering if the investment decisions you’ve made were a mistake that will', metadata={'source': 'book4'}), Document(page_content='hurt their future. Having a gap between what you can technically endure\\nversus what’s emotionally possible is an overlooked version of room for\\nerror.\\nAnother is saving for retirement. We can look at history and see, for example,\\nthat the U.S. stock market has returned an annual average of 6.8% after\\ninflation since the 1870s. It’s a reasonable first approximation to use that as\\nan estimate of what to expect on your own diversified portfolio when saving\\nfor retirement. You can use those return assumptions to back into the amount\\nof money you’ll need to save each month to achieve your target nestegg.\\nBut what if future returns are lower? Or what if long-term history is a good\\nestimate of the long-term future, but your target retirement date ends up\\nfalling in the middle of a brutal bear market, like 2009? What if a future bear\\nmarket scares you out of stocks and you end up missing a future bull market,\\nso the returns you actually earn are less than the market average? What if you\\nneed to cash out your retirement accounts in your 30s to pay for a medical\\nmishap?\\nThe answer to those what ifs is, “You won’t be able to retire like you once\\npredicted.” Which can be a disaster.\\nThe solution is simple: Use room for error when estimating your future\\nreturns. This is more art than science. For my own investments, which I’ll\\ndescribe more in chapter 20, I assume the future returns I’ll earn in my\\nlifetime will be ⅓ lower than the historic average. So I save more than I\\nwould if I assumed the future will resemble the past. It’s my margin of safety.\\nThe future may be worse than ⅓ lower than the past, but no margin of safety\\noffers a 100% guarantee. A one-third buffer is enough to allow me to sleep\\nwell at night. And if the future does resemble the past, I’ll be pleasantly\\nsurprised. “The best way to achieve felicity is to aim low,” says Charlie\\nMunger. Wonderful.\\nAn important cousin of room for error is what I call optimism bias in risk-\\ntaking, or “Russian roulette should statistically work” syndrome: An', metadata={'source': 'book4'}), Document(page_content='attachment to favorable odds when the downside is unacceptable in any\\ncircumstances.\\nNassim Taleb says, “You can be risk loving and yet completely averse to\\nruin.” And indeed, you should.\\nThe idea is that you have to take risk to get ahead, but no risk that can wipe\\nyou out is ever worth taking. The odds are in your favor when playing\\nRussian roulette. But the downside is not worth the potential upside. There is\\nno margin of safety that can compensate for the risk.\\nSame with money. The odds of many lucrative things are in your favor. Real\\nestate prices go up most years, and during most years you’ll get a paycheck\\nevery other week. But if something has 95% odds of being right, the 5% odds\\nof being wrong means you will almost certainly experience the downside at\\nsome point in your life. And if the cost of the downside is ruin, the upside the\\nother 95% of the time likely isn’t worth the risk, no matter how appealing it\\nlooks.\\nLeverage is the devil here. Leverage—taking on debt to make your money go\\nfurther—pushes routine risks into something capable of producing ruin. The\\ndanger is that rational optimism most of the time masks the odds of ruin some\\nof the time. The result is we systematically underestimate risk. Housing\\nprices fell 30% last decade. A few companies defaulted on their debt. That’s\\ncapitalism. It happens. But those with high leverage had a double wipeout:\\nNot only were they left broke, but being wiped out erased every opportunity\\nto get back in the game at the very moment opportunity was ripe. A\\nhomeowner wiped out in 2009 had no chance of taking advantage of cheap\\nmortgage rates in 2010. Lehman Brothers had no chance of investing in\\ncheap debt in 2009. They were done.\\nTo get around this, I think of my own money as barbelled. I take risks with\\none portion and am terrified with the other.

It’s hard to make enduring long-term decisions when your view of what\\nyou’ll want in the future is likely to shift.\\nThe End of History Illusion is what psychologists call the tendency for\\npeople to be keenly aware of how much they’ve changed in the past, but to\\nunderestimate how much their personalities, desires, and goals are likely to\\nchange in the future.

His mouth was radiating pain.\\nHis dentist put him under crude anesthesia to ease the pain. When Clarence\\nawoke hours later he had 16 fewer teeth and his tonsils removed.\\nAnd then everything went wrong. Clarence died a week later from his\\nsurgery’s complications.\\nHis wife sued the dentist, but not because the surgery went awry. Every\\nsurgery risked death in 1931.\\nClarence, she said, never consented to the procedures in the first place, and\\nwouldn’t if he were asked.\\nThe case wove through courts, but went nowhere. Consent between doctor\\nand patient wasn’t black and white in 1931. One court summed up the idea\\nthat doctors require freedom to make the best medical decisions: “Without\\nsuch, we could not enjoy the advancement of science.”\\nFor most of history the ethos of medicine was that the doctor’s job was to fix\\nthe patient, and what the patient thought about the doctor’s treatment plans\\nwasn’t relevant. Dr. Jay Katz wrote about the philosophy in his book The\\nSilent World Between Doctor and Patient:', metadata={'source': 'book4'}), Document(page_content='Doctors felt that in order to accomplish that objective they were obligated to\\nattend to their patients’ physical and emotional needs and to do so on their\\nown authority, without consulting with their patients about the decisions that\\nneeded to be made. The idea that patients may also be entitled to sharing the\\nburdens of decisions with their doctors was never part of the ethos of\\nmedicine.\\nThis wasn’t ego or malice. It was a belief in two points:\\nEvery patient wants to be cured.\\nThere is a universal and right way to cure them.\\nNot requiring patient consent in treatment plans makes sense if you believe in\\nthose two points.\\nBut that’s not how medicine works.\\nIn the last 50 years medical schools subtly shifted teaching away from\\ntreating disease and toward treating patients. That meant laying out the\\noptions of treatment plans, and then letting the patient decide the best path\\nforward.\\nThis trend was partly driven by patient-protection laws, partly by Katz’s\\ninfluential book, which argued that patients have wildly different views about\\nwhat’s worth it in medicine, so their beliefs have to be taken into\\nconsideration. Katz wrote:\\nIt is dangerous nonsense to assert that in the practice of their art and science', metadata={'source': 'book4'}), Document(page_content='physicians can rely on their benevolent intentions, their abilities to judge\\nwhat is the right thing to do ...

You’ll also have a\\nbetter chance of finding the right role models.\\nLess ego, more wealth. Saving money is the gap between your ego and\\nyour income, and wealth is what you don’t see. So wealth is created by\\nsuppressing what you could buy today in order to have more stuff or\\nmore options in the future. No matter how much you earn, you will never\\nbuild wealth unless you can put a lid on how much fun you can have with\\nyour money right now, today.\\nManage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night. That’s\\ndifferent from saying you should aim to earn the highest returns or save\\na specific percentage of your income. Some people won’t sleep well\\nunless they’re earning the highest returns; others will only get a good\\nrest if they’re conservatively invested. To each their own. But the\\nfoundation of, “does this help me sleep at night?” is the best universal\\nguidepost for all financial decisions.\\nIf you want to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing\\nyou can do is increase your time horizon. Time is the most powerful\\nforce in investing. It makes little things grow big and big mistakes fade\\naway.

No matter what you’re doing with your\\nmoney you should be comfortable with a lot of stuff not working. That’s\\njust how the world is.

Chasing the highest returns or leveraging my assets to live the\\nmost luxurious life has little interest to me. Both look like games people do to\\nimpress their friends, and both have hidden risks. I mostly just want to wake\\nup every day knowing my family and I can do whatever we want to do on our\\nown terms. Every financial decision we make revolves around that goal.\\nMy parents lived their adult years in two stages: dirt poor and moderately\\nwell off. My father became a doctor when he was 40 and already had three\\nkids. Earning a doctor’s salary did not offset the frugal mentality that is\\nforced when supporting three hungry kids while in medical school, and my\\nparents spent the good years living well below their means with a high\\nsavings rate.

Being able to wake up one morning and change what\\nyou’re doing, on your own terms, whenever you’re ready, seems like the\\ngrandmother of all financial goals. Independence, to me, doesn’t mean you’ll\\nstop working. It means you only do the work you like with people you like at\\nthe times you want for as long as you want.\\nAnd achieving some level of independence does not rely on earning a\\ndoctor’s income. It’s mostly a matter of keeping your expectations in check\\nand living below your means. Independence, at any income level, is driven by\\nyour savings rate. And past a certain level of income your savings rate is\\ndriven by your ability to keep your lifestyle expectations from running away.\\nMy wife and I met in college and moved in with each other years before we\\ngot married. After school we both had entry-level jobs with entry-level pay,\\nand settled into a moderate lifestyle. All lifestyles exist on a spectrum, and\\nwhat is decent to one person can feel like royalty or poverty to another. But at\\nour incomes we got what we considered a decent apartment, a decent car,\\ndecent clothes, decent food. Comfortable, but nothing close to fancy.\\nDespite more than a decade of rising incomes—myself in finance, my wife in\\nhealth care—we’ve more or less stayed at that lifestyle ever since. That’s\\npushed our savings rate continuously higher. Virtually every dollar of raise\\nhas accrued to savings—our “independence fund.” We now live considerably\\nbelow our means, which tells you little about our income and more about our\\ndecision to maintain a lifestyle that we established in our 20s.\\nIf there’s a part of our household financial plan I’m proud of it’s that we got\\nthe goalpost of lifestyle desires to stop moving at a young age. Our savings\\nrate is fairly high, but we rarely feel like we’re repressively frugal because\\nour aspirations for more stuff haven’t moved much. It’s not that our\\naspirations are nonexistent—we like nice stuff and live comfortably.

A\\nsecondary benefit of maintaining a lifestyle below what you can afford is\\navoiding the psychological treadmill of keeping up with the Joneses.\\nComfortably living below what you can afford, without much desire for\\nmore, removes a tremendous amount of social pressure that many people in\\nthe modern first world subject themselves to.

Any rational advisor would recommend taking advantage of cheap\\nmoney and investing extra savings in higher-return assets, like stocks. But\\nour goal isn’t to be coldly rational; just psychologically reasonable.\\nThe independent feeling I get from owning our house outright far exceeds the\\nknown financial gain I’d get from leveraging our assets with a cheap\\nmortgage. Eliminating the monthly payment feels better than maximizing the\\nlong-term value of our assets. It makes me feel independent.\\nI don’t try to defend this decision to those pointing out its flaws, or those who\\nwould never do the same. On paper it’s defenseless. But it works for us. We\\nlike it. That’s what matters. Good decisions aren’t always rational. At some\\npoint you have to choose between being happy or being “right.”\\nWe also keep a higher percentage of our assets in cash than most financial\\nadvisors would recommend—something around 20% of our assets outside the\\nvalue of our house. This is also close to indefensible on paper, and I’m not\\nrecommending it to others. It’s just what works for us.\\nWe do it because cash is the oxygen of independence, and—more\\nimportantly—we never want to be forced to sell the stocks we own.

The few people who know the details of our finances ask,\\n“What are you saving for? A house? A boat? A new car?” No, none of those.\\nI’m saving for a world where curveballs are more common than we expect.\\nNot being forced to sell stocks to cover an expense also means we’re\\nincreasing the odds of letting the stocks we own compound for the longest\\nperiod of time. Charlie Munger put it well: “The first rule of compounding is\\nto never interrupt it unnecessarily.”\\nHow my family thinks about investing\\nI started my career as a stock picker. At the time we only owned individual\\nstocks, mostly large companies like Berkshire Hathaway and Procter &\\nGamble, mixed with smaller stocks I considered deep value investments. Go\\nback to my 20s and at any given point I held something like 25 individual\\nstocks.\\nI don’t know how I did as a stock picker. Did I beat the market? I’m not sure.\\nLike most who try, I didn’t keep a good score. Either way, I’ve shifted my\\nviews and now every stock we own is a low-cost index fund.\\nI don’t have anything against actively picking stocks, either on your own or\\nthrough giving your money to an active fund manager. I think some people\\ncan outperform the market averages—it’s just very hard, and harder than\\nmost people think.\\nIf I had to summarize my views on investing, it’s this: Every investor should\\npick a strategy that has the highest odds of successfully meeting their goals.\\nAnd I think for most investors, dollar-cost averaging into a low-cost index', metadata={'source': 'book4'}), Document(page_content='fund will provide the highest odds of long-term success.\\nThat doesn’t mean index investing will always work. It doesn’t mean it’s for\\neveryone. And it doesn’t mean active stock picking is doomed to fail. In\\ngeneral, this industry has become too entrenched on one side or the other—\\nparticularly those vehemently against active investing.\\nBeating the market should be hard; the odds of success should be low. If they\\nweren’t, everyone would do it, and if everyone did it there would be no\\nopportunity. So no one should be surprised that the majority of those trying to\\nbeat the market fail to do so. (The statistics show 85% of large-cap active\\nmanagers didn’t beat the S&P 500 over the decade ending 2019.)⁷¹\\nI know people who think it’s insane to try to beat the market but encourage\\ntheir kids to reach for the stars and try to become professional athletes. To\\neach their own. Life is about playing the odds, and we all think about odds a\\nlittle differently.\\nOver the years I came around to the view that we’ll have a high chance of\\nmeeting all of our family’s financial goals if we consistently invest money\\ninto a low-cost index fund for decades on end, leaving the money alone to\\ncompound. A lot of this view comes from our lifestyle of frugal spending. If\\nyou can meet all your goals without having to take the added risk that comes\\nfrom trying to outperform the market, then what’s the point of even trying? I\\ncan afford to not be the greatest investor in the world, but I can’t afford to be\\na bad one. When I think of it that way, the choice to buy the index and hold\\non is a no-brainer for us. I know not everyone will agree with that logic,\\nespecially my friends whose job it is to beat the market. I respect what they\\ndo. But this is what works for us.\\nWe invest money from every paycheck into these index funds—a\\ncombination of U.S. and international stocks. There’s no set goal—it’s just\\nwhatever is leftover after we spend. We max out retirement accounts in the\\nsame funds, and contribute to our kids’ 529 college savings plans.\\nAnd that’s about it.

The share of income going toward debt and\\nlease payments is just over 8% for the highest income groups—those with the\\nbiggest income gains—but over 21% for those below the 50th percentile.\\nThe difference between this climbing debt and the debt increase that took\\nplace during the 1950s and ’60s is that the recent jump started from a high\\nbase.\\nEconomist Hyman Minsky described the beginning of debt crises: The\\nmoment when people take on more debt than they can service. It’s an ugly,\\npainful moment. It’s like Wile E. Coyote looking down, realizing he’s\\nscrewed, and falling precipitously.\\nWhich, of course, is what happened in 2008.\\n9. Once a paradigm is in place it is very hard to turn it around.\\nA lot of debt was shed after 2008. And then interest rates plunged.

That helped those who owned\\nthat debt—mostly rich people.\\nTax cuts over the last 20 years have predominantly gone to those with higher\\nincomes. People with higher incomes send their kids to the best colleges.\\nThose kids can go on to earn higher incomes and invest in corporate debt that\\nwill be backstopped by the Fed, own stocks that will be supported by various\\ngovernment policies, and so on.\\nNone of these things are problems in and of themselves, which is why they\\nstay in place.\\nBut they’re symptomatic of the bigger thing that’s happened since the early\\n1980s: The economy works better for some people than others. Success isn’t\\nas meritocratic as it used to be and, when success is granted, it’s rewarded\\nwith higher gains than in previous eras.\\nYou don’t have to think that’s morally right or wrong.\\nAnd, again, in this story it doesn’t matter why it happened.\\nIt just matters that it did happen, and it caused the economy to shift away\\nfrom people’s expectations that were set after the war: That there’s a broad\\nmiddle class without systematic inequality, where your neighbors next door\\nand a few miles down the road live a life that’s pretty similar to yours.\\nPart of the reason these expectations have stuck around for 35 years after they\\nshifted away from reality is because they felt so good for so many people\\nwhen they were valid.

The Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street, Brexit, and Donald Trump each\\nrepresents a group shouting, “Stop the ride, I want off.”\\nThe details of their shouting are different, but they’re all shouting—at least in\\npart—because stuff isn’t working for them within the context of the post-war\\nexpectation that stuff should work roughly the same for roughly everyone.\\nYou can scoff at linking the rise of Trump to income inequality alone.

As a matter of fact, I\\nrecommend you skip through the book reading all the stories first. They will\\ninspire you to read all the way through and actually do the Proven Plan to\\nFinancial Fitness.\\nMany years ago I was given a calling: to show people the truth about debt\\nand money and to give them the hope and tools necessary to set themselves\\nfree financially. First, I did that with a few speaking engagements and a small\\nself-published book titled Financial Peace. Later Financial Peace was\\npublished by a New York publisher and became our first New York Times\\nbestseller. I began doing a small local radio show that has now grown to more\\nthan 450 stations and millions of listeners that tune in weekly. We started\\nteaching a thirteen-week class called Financial Peace University, which has\\nhad over 1 million families attend. Then came The Total Money Makeover.\\nI am positive that personal finance is 80 percent behavior and only 20\\npercent head knowledge. Our concentration on behavior—realizing that most\\nfolks have a good idea of what to do with money but not how to do it—has\\nled us to a different view of personal finance. Most financial people make the\\nmistake of trying to show you the numbers, thinking that you just don’t get\\nthe math. I am sure that the problem with my money is the guy in my mirror.\\nIf he will behave, he can make the money thing work. The math of wealth\\nbuilding is not rocket science; it is simple—but you have to DO IT!\\nSo the proven Total Money Makeover plan I teach has become very\\nsuccessful not because I have found the secrets of the rich. Not because I had\\nsome revelation that no one else has ever had about credit cards. Not because I\\nam the only one with a “Debt Snowball” plan. Instead, this proven plan is\\nhaving a national impact because I have realized that to change your money\\nthing, you have to change. You have to change your life. When you change\\nyour life, you will get out of debt, give, and invest at an unbelievable rate.\\nWhen you read the stories in this book, you will read not about mathematics,', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='or magic systems, but about changed lives. You will read about transformed\\nmarriages and relationships. Because when you change your life, you really\\nchange your life.\\nSo when Mike Hyatt, the president and CEO of Thomas Nelson\\nPublishers, brought me the concept for a Total Money Makeover book, I\\nbecame very excited. I became excited because I knew this book would inspire\\nreaders to take immediate action through a simple, step-by-step process that\\ncould only lead to life-changing results. Hope—the light at the end of the\\ntunnel, that is, not an oncoming train—is a very powerful force. The Total\\nMoney Makeover has given HOPE to hundreds of thousands of families. This\\nbook has given them hope to win, and that hope has caused them to take\\naction and claim ultimate victory over their financial struggles and worries—\\nand to actually win! The number of people that I meet across this nation who\\ntell me this is the first book of any kind they have read in ten years is\\nstaggering. The Total Money Makeover is a book for everyone. It is for high-\\nincome earners, as I am. And it is for someone beginning at the bottom,\\nwhich is where I once was.\\nYou are about to read about a process, a proven plan, to win. You will find\\nthe plan to be very simple yet very inspiring. The principles are not mine. I\\nstole them all from God and your grandmother. The principles are common\\nsense, which isn’t so common anymore. The plan is mine—and I’m no\\ngenius—created by simply observing literally millions of lives with whom I\\nhave interacted through radio, TV, books, classes, the Internet, e-mail,\\npodcasts, and our Live Events. I have successfully bottled common sense\\nabout money into a plan that anyone can do. And millions are!\\nA couple of decades ago, when I first started talking about these principles,\\nI knew they had helped my wife, Sharon, and me survive going broke and\\nbegin to prosper. The first hundred times I spoke on money, I wasn’t as\\nconfident of the principles as I am now. Nowadays I look into the eyes of a\\ngazillion people who have followed this plan and experienced, as we did,\\nexcitement, hope, and gratitude. I am so thankful that I have not only given\\nthem a proven plan but have also inspired them to change their family tree.', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='I am so confident in The Total Money Makeover principles and this process\\nthat I cannot stand it when someone doesn’t get it. Because I am so\\nconvinced my plan will work for everyone, my answers to the same questions\\nwill never change. By recognizing and identifying some basic truths and\\neveryday common sense, I have convinced millions of people to change their\\nlives—to have a Total Money Makeover. Are you next?', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='Read this\\nBEFORE You Buy\\nThe Book!\\nWhat This Book Is NOT\\nI know it may be hard for you to believe, but I get a lot of hate mail and\\ncriticism. This book and what I have or have not said in it has generated a lot\\nof negativity and name-calling. That is fun. Not fun because I set out to offend\\nor because I love reading the nasty things people often say. It is fun because\\nthe negativity means two things: One, for some people we are touching a\\nnerve that needs to be touched in order for them to change their lives, and\\ntwo, I am actively and passionately pursuing the truth. (Aristotle once said\\n“To avoid criticism say nothing, do nothing, and be nothing.”) I can’t help\\nmillions of people change their lives by saying nothing, doing nothing, and\\nbeing nothing. So I take the anger, the criticism, and even the hate mail as\\nencouragement.\\nMy publisher suggested I “answer my critics.” I will pass. My\\ngrandmother used to say, “Those convinced against their will are of the same\\nopinion still.” However, I do not want you, dear reader, to be misled. So it is\\nappropriate that I tell you what this book is NOT. That way you can decide\\nwhether or not to spend your hard-earned money on it.\\nThis Book Is NOT Sophisticated or Complicated\\nIf you are looking for a detailed, in-depth guide to investing, you have not\\nfound it. If you are looking for boring academic chirping that will put you to\\nsleep using words only to support the author’s ego, you have not found it.\\nWhat I have discovered is that some of the most profound and life-changing\\ntruths you will ever discover are very simple.', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='In our culture we worship the complicated and the sophisticated. If you\\nknow how to work your DVD player, you may not have a good one. In the\\nfinancial world we have been taught to be arrogant snobs. Some believe that\\nsimple ideas are not profound, that instead, simple ideas are for the “little\\npeople.” That is a false and arrogant notion. I have met with thousands of\\nmillionaires, and in almost every case they keep their investing and money\\nphilosophies very uncomplicated. Just this week I was discussing investing\\nand business structure with a friend of mine whose net worth is over twenty\\nmillion dollars, and his words to me were, “I always keep it simple and\\nclean.” Only the financial goobers like to complicate things for the sake of\\njustifying their existence or justifying how much they paid for their education.\\nPlease do not look here for a detailed guide to set up an estate plan or a deep\\ntheory on investing. That is not what I do. What I do is help people\\nunderstand and act on time-honored truths about money that will truly change\\nyour whole life.\\nThis Book Is NOT Something That Has Never Been Said\\nThere are many great money authors out there today, and there are even more\\nin our past. Very little that you read in this book will be something that\\nsomeone else has not written or said. We often say on our radio show that we\\ngive the same financial advice your grandmother would, only we keep our\\nteeth in. I suggest you read a lot of different people, as I do. I have invented\\nvery little in this area of money. What I have done is packaged the time-\\nhonored information into a process that is doable and has inspired millions of\\npeople to act on it. Most of us know what to do; we just have trouble doing\\nit. How do you lose weight? Exercise more and eat less. I know that, and yet\\nI bought and read a couple of books on the subject while I took action, and I\\nlost thirty pounds. Did the authors of those books tell me big ideas that were\\ngroundbreaking?

Ignorance is not lack of intelligence; it is simply “not\\nknowing.” Sadly, many intelligent but ignorant people seem to think that\\nmaking a 12 percent rate of return on your money in a long-term investment is\\nimpossible. And that if I state that there is a 12 percent rate of return available,\\nthen I have lied to you or misled you.\\nI recommend good growth stock-type mutual funds in this book as a long-\\nterm investment and dare to state that you should make 12 percent on your\\nmoney over time. The supporting data for that bold statement can be found by\\nlooking at the historical averages of the S&P 500 index. Widely regarded as\\nthe best single gauge of the US equities market, the Standard & Poor’s 500 is\\nan index with 500 of the largest companies in leading industries of the US\\neconomy. The S&P 500 has averaged 11.67 percent per year for the last\\neighty plus years, as of this writing. This includes the big drop in the 2008\\nmarket. Most experts and anyone who has had even one finance class agree\\nthat the S&P 500 is a great statistical measure of stock market returns. This is\\nsuch a standard, or bellwether, that virtually every stock fund will show you\\nits returns in comparison to the S&P 500.\\nI purchased a Growth and Income Stock Mutual Fund many years ago, that\\nI still invest in, and it has averaged 12.03 percent per year since 1934 (75\\nyears as of this writing). I bought another last week that has averaged over\\n13.9 percent per year since 1973, as of this writing. And yet another with\\naverage annual returns of 12.01 percent since 1984, and another averaging\\n12.39 percent since 1973, and yet another averaging 11.72 percent since 1952.\\nAny decent broker with the heart of a teacher can, in his or her sleep, lead you\\nto funds with long track records averaging over 12 percent.

Yes, I have been or am licensed in real estate, insurance, and\\ninvestments. Yes, I do have many of the stupid letters to put after my name.\\nBut the thing that qualifies me most to teach about money is that I have done\\nstupid with zeros on the end. I have been there, done that. I have a PhD in D-\\nU-M-B. So I know what it is like to be scared and scarred. I know what it is\\nlike to have my marriage hanging by a thread because of financial stress. I\\nknow what it is like to have my hopes and dreams crushed by my own stupid\\ndecisions. That qualifies me uniquely to teach and to love hurting people.\\nThe other huge qualifier is that I used the principles I teach to personally\\nbuild wealth.

To properly view\\nbehavior and to understand how to change behavior intelligently, we must\\nconsider several things. Behavior intelligently viewed takes into account the\\nemotional, the relational, the family history, the socioeconomic impacts, and\\nthe spiritual. To ignore any of these while discussing behavior change about\\nmoney is incomplete and very naive. So I openly discuss the spiritual in this\\nbook. As a Christian, I include some Bible verses.

Either way, you have been warned.\\nThis Book Is NOT Wrong\\nDon’t confuse extreme confidence with arrogance. I am extremely confident\\nthat this material works, because millions of people have benefited from it.

I couldn’t in good\\nconscience do that. Financial Peace has sold nearly 2 million copies as of this\\nwriting, so did I really need to write another book? I came to the conclusion\\nthat there was a distinct difference in the two projects. Financial Peace is\\n“what to do with money.” It is a great textbook for commonsense money\\nmanagement. So how is The Total Money Makeover different? It is more than\\na “what to do” book—it is a “how to do it” plan.

As\\nwith all strong storms, the only houses that survived were the ones that were\\nbuilt well, on a solid foundation. The rest were blown over.

The 30,000-foot view that\\nyou would get from an airplane might look like this:\\nBroke people in serious financial trouble borrowed money from greedy\\nbankers at horrible terms and high interest rates to buy homes. The loans were\\nnot prime (good) loans, so they were accurately called SUBprime loans. That', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='just means these mortgages were less than good. Duh.\\nThis rip-off lending has always been done, but never on such a large scale.\\nIn an effort to make more profits to keep their stock prices up, banks and\\ninvestment bankers began to buy these loans in bulk—and they bought lots of\\nthem. What was unthinkable in the investment community just a few years\\nearlier became common practice.\\nFormerly legitimate, upstanding, major banks and investment bankers\\nessentially became loan sharks using very sophisticated financial instruments.\\nFor years, the mortgage industry had packaged good mortgages together and\\nsold them as bonds. You have probably heard of Fannie Mae Bonds. That\\nused to refer to a group of good Fannie Mae mortgages that were wrapped\\ntogether and sold as unit, or bond. During this period of stupidity, however,\\nthe SUBprime (bad) loans were packaged together and sold as bonds—a lot of\\nthem.\\nWe live in a cause-and-effect world. What you sow, you will reap. In a\\nshocking turn of events, the broke people didn’t pay their mortgage payments\\n(he says sarcastically). This, for some unknown reason, seemed to surprise the\\ngreedy bankers. Surprise! Broke people can’t pay ridiculous house payments!\\nGo figure.\\nThe big problem, however, was scale. A lot of broke people didn’t pay\\ntheir payments. So, foreclosure numbers began to rise rapidly. In some boom\\nmarkets, where the real estate prices had shot up artificially high, the\\nforeclosures began bringing home prices down. And down and down.\\nWith values dropping so low, relatively secure and responsible home-\\nowners started to get in trouble too. Fear broke out on Wall Street, and stock\\nprices started dropping. By the time the fear got to Washington, it had\\nbecome a full-blown panic.

People stopped buying washers and dryers, so the washer-and-dryer\\nmanufacturer started laying people off, and unemployment rose. This, of\\ncourse, just made the cycle go around again, forcing real estate and stock\\nprices even lower.\\nGood News, Bad News\\nThe good news is that we are recovering and will continue to recover.

The first lesson of\\nthis economic storm is that your financial process and principles must work in\\ngood times and in bad times—otherwise, they don’t work. Our economy had\\nbeen so good for so long that really stupid ideas had been working on the\\nshort term. That fooled people into believing that stupid had become smart.\\nIn other words, stupid hadn’t been stress tested in quite a while; when it\\nfinally was, it came up looking, well, stupid.\\nWhen times are booming, you can do dumb things with money, get\\nsloppy, and take huge risks without realizing it. I have heard it said this way:\\n“Even a turkey can fly in a tornado.” People were running around, buying\\nthings they couldn’t afford with money they didn’t have, to impress people\\nthey didn’t even like; and they were doing it in record numbers. Worse, they\\nseemed to get away with it!\\nThey were like the two little pigs with straw and twig homes: As long as\\nthe sun was shining, life was a party, and the pig with brick seemed kind of\\nnerdy, or overly conservative, or even fanatical. But when their stupid theories\\nwere stress tested, their houses fell.\\nJim Collins, one of America’s greatest business writers, has a book out\\ncalled How the Mighty Fall. In this book, he discusses the five stages of\\ndecline when a business fails, or falls. There is a great application here for our\\nnation’s economy and for your life and mine.\\nCollins says the first stage of decline is marked by hubris. Pride and\\narrogance, mixed with a false notion of invincibility, lead the mighty to take\\nhuge, ridiculous risks. In our case, that would be borrowing lots of money\\nand not saving any because “my job is ‘stable.’ I can afford the ‘easy', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='payments’ with my ‘job.’”\\nThis hubris causes sloppiness and denial of risk. Hey, that sounds like me\\ntwenty years ago—right before I went broke. I had been taught a group of\\nmyths—lies—that I accepted as truth about money. I thought the rules of risk\\nand restraint didn’t apply to me because I was so smart. That led me to build\\na house of cards that fell the first time there was a light breeze, much less a\\nreal storm.\\nHere’s the lesson: Just because you see a turkey flying in a tornado doesn’t\\nmean turkeys can fly. Just because some wild-eyed theory of investing,\\nborrowing, and living without cash reserves works in good times doesn’t\\nmean you can survive a storm. Remember, your ways of handling money have\\nto work in good times and in bad.\\nSkinny-Dipping\\nWarren Buffett has a great saying: “When the tide goes out, you can tell who\\nwas skinny-dipping.” I have taught for years that if you have a bad map, you\\nwill be late for—or completely miss—the party. The principles that you build\\nyour life on will determine your level of success. If you plan your marriage\\naround a bad map, or bad set of assumptions, then it will likely fail. If you\\nhave all the good intentions in the world, but build your financial house on\\nbad ideas, it will fall. I personally experienced this a long time ago.

And they\\ndiscovered they were wrong the hard way—through pain.\\nOverspending that doesn’t feel like overspending because things are going\\nwell is still overspending. Using debt to invest in real estate or the stock\\nmarket and the hope of a quick return will cause you to go broke the minute\\nthe market turns.

How much is the severance?”\\nThe company gave him more than $70,000 in severance, and he is now\\nstarting his own business—something he has wanted to do for years. He\\nwasn’t stressed, but instead saw only opportunity, because he was ready. As\\nof this writing, he will make almost double his old salary with his new\\nbusiness this year.

A Cash Value policy is an insurance product that packages\\ninsurance and savings together. Do not invest money in life insurance; the\\nreturns are horrible. Your insurance person will show you wonderful\\nprojections, but none of these policies perform as projected.\\nNo one gets rich quick by using secret information.\\nLet’s look at an example. If a thirty-year-old man has $100 per month to\\nspend on life insurance and shops the top five Cash Value companies, he will\\nfind he can purchase an average of $125,000 in insurance for his family. The', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='pitch is to get a policy that will build up savings for retirement, which is\\nwhat a Cash Value policy does. However, if this same guy purchases twenty-\\nyear level term insurance with coverage of $125,000, the cost will be only $7\\nper month, not $100. Wow. If he goes with the Cash Value option, the other\\n$93 per month should be in savings, right? Well, not really; you see, there\\nare expenses. Expenses? How much? All of the $93 per month disappears in\\ncommissions and expenses for the first three years; after that, the return will\\naverage 2.6 percent per year for Whole Life, 4.2 percent for Universal Life, and\\n7.4 percent for the new-and-improved Variable Life policy that includes\\nmutual funds. These statistics are from Consumer Reports, Consumer\\nFederation of America, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance, and Fortune magazine,\\nso these are the real numbers. Additionally, a recent article in National\\nUnderwriter, The Industry Mouthpiece, showed charts of returns from fourteen\\nnational companies. The returns they show average only 6.29 percent over\\ntwenty years. Either way, this product is a really bad idea!\\nWorse yet, with Whole Life and Universal Life, the savings you finally\\nbuild up after being ripped off for years don’t go to your family upon your\\ndeath; the only benefit paid to your family is the face value of the policy, the\\n$125,000 of our example. The truth is that you would be better off to get the\\n$7 term policy and put the extra $93 in a cookie jar! At least after three years\\nyou would have $3,000, and when you died your family would get your\\nsavings.\\nAs you continue in this book and learn how to have a Total Money\\nMakeover, you will begin investing well. Then, when you are fifty-seven and\\nthe kids are grown and gone, the house is paid for, and you have $700,000 in\\nmutual funds, you’ll become self-insured. That means when your twenty-year\\nterm is up, you shouldn’t need life insurance at all— because with no kids to\\nfeed, no house payment, and $700,000, your spouse will just have to suffer\\nthrough if you die without insurance.\\nMyth: Playing the lottery and other forms of gambling will make\\nyou rich.', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='Truth: The lottery is a tax on the poor and on people who can’t do\\nmath.\\nJust the other day, I was in a lottery state for a speaking engagement.

The\\nfastest way to become a homeowner is through a Total Money Makeover\\nwhile renting the cheapest thing you can suffer through. The purchase of a\\ntrailer is not a shortcut, but a setback on the path to owning real estate that\\ngoes up in value. If the typical consumer considering buying your home can\\nwalk up and tell it was ever a trailer in any form, your home will go down,\\nnot up, in value.\\nThe only exception to the “no trailers” rule is Ron’s plan. Ron graduated\\nfrom Financial Peace University and was on track for a Total Money\\nMakeover. Ron and his wife prayerfully decided to sell their nice $120,000\\nhome on which they owed only $50,000. They bought a small farm and a\\nvery used $3,000 trailer.

Also, as a contractor Ron built the home for pennies on the dollar, so\\nit didn’t take them long to finish paying for the home. They sold the $3,000\\ntrailer for $3,200; after all, $3,000 trailers have lost about all their value, so\\nthe sale comes down to negotiating.\\nMyth: Prepaying my funeral or my kids’ college expenses is a good\\nway to invest and protect myself against inflation.\\nTruth: Plans for prepaid funerals and college expenses give low\\nrates of return and put money in the other guy’s pocket.', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='When you prepay something, your return on investment (interest) is the\\namount the item will go up in value before you use it. In other words, by\\nprepaying, you avoid the price increases, and that is your return. Prepaying\\nitems is like investing at the item’s inflation rate. For example, prepaying\\ncollege tuition will save you the amount tuition goes up between the time\\nyou lock in and the time your child begins his college education. The average\\ninflation rate for tuition nationally is about 8 percent, so prepaying tuition is\\nlike investing money at 8 percent.

These\\ncompanies “manage” your debt by taking one monthly payment from you and\\ndistributing the money among your creditors, with whom they’ve often\\nworked out lower payments and lower interest.

We pay and pay and pay\\npremiums, and sometimes we feel insurance-poor. There are certainly many\\ngimmicks in the world of insurance. We cover insurance in detail at Financial\\nPeace University and in other books, but you must have insurance in some\\nbasic categories as part of a Total Money Makeover:\\n• Auto and Homeowner Insurance—Choose higher deductibles in order to save on\\npremiums. With high liability limits, these are the best buys in the insurance world.\\n• Life Insurance—Purchase twenty-year level term insurance equal to about ten times\\nyour income. Term insurance is cheap and the only way to go; never use life\\ninsurance as a place to save money.\\n• Long-Term Disability—If you are thirty-two years old, you are twelve times more\\nlikely to become disabled than to die by age sixty-five. The best place to buy\\ndisability insurance is through work at a fraction of the cost. You can usually get\\ncoverage that equals from 50 to 70 percent of your income.', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='• Health Insurance—The number-one cause of bankruptcy today is medical bills;\\nnumber two is credit cards. One way to control costs is to look for large deductibles to\\nlower your premium. The HSA (Health Savings Account) is a great way to save on\\npremiums. The high deductible creates a much lower premium, and this plan allows\\nyou to save for medical expenses in a tax-free savings account.\\n• Long-Term Care Insurance—If you are over sixty, buy Long-Term Care insurance to\\ncover in-home care or nursing home care. The average nursing home stay costs\\n$40,000 per year, which will crack and scramble a nest egg in a heartbeat. Dad in the\\nnursing home can use up Mom’s $250,000 savings in just a few short years.

I have developed the Baby Steps over years of counseling\\none-on-one, in small-group discussions, with real-world lives in Financial\\nPeace University, and by answering questions on our radio show. Tens of\\nthousands have followed this tried-and-true system to achieve their Total\\nMoney Makeover. The term baby steps comes from the comedy What About\\nBob? starring Bill Murray. Bill plays a crazy guy who drives his psychiatrist\\ncrazy. The therapist has written a book called Baby Steps. The statement\\n“You can get anywhere if you simply go one step at a time” is the framework\\nfor the movie. We will use the Baby Steps to walk through our Total Money\\nMakeover. Why do the Baby Steps work? I thought you would never ask.\\n“You can get anywhere if you simply go one step at a time.”\\nEating an Elephant Gives You Energy\\nThe way you eat an elephant is one bite at a time. Find something to do and\\ndo that with vigor until it is complete; then and only then do you move to\\nthe next step. If you try to do everything at once, you will fail. If you woke up\\nthis morning and realized you needed to lose 100 pounds, build your\\ncardiovascular system, and tone your muscles, what would you do? If on the\\nfirst day of your new plan you quit eating, run three miles, and lift all the\\nweight you can lift with every muscle group, you will collapse. If you don’t\\ncollapse the first day, wait forty-eight hours for the muscle groups to lock up\\nand the cardio to go crazy, and you will be bingeing on food shortly thereafter.\\nWhen I went on a quest for a better body and better health a few years ago, my', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='wise trainer didn’t try to kill me the first day.

Plus, if I\\nhad tried to do everything at once, I would have been overwhelmed and\\nfrustrated with my inability to do it all.\\nThe power of focus is what causes our Baby Steps to work. When you try\\nto do everything at once, progress can be very slow. When you put 3 percent\\nin your 401k, $50 extra on the house payment, and $5 extra on the credit\\ncard, you dilute your efforts. Because you attack several areas at once, you\\ndon’t finish anything you start for a long time. That makes you feel that you\\naren’t accomplishing anything, which is very dangerous. If you feel that\\nnothing is getting done, you will soon lose energy for the task of money\\nmanagement altogether. The power of focus is that it works. Things happen.\\nYou check stuff off your list. Life gives you an “attaboy” in the form of actual\\nvisible progress.\\nThe power of priority also causes the Baby Steps to work. Each of these\\nsteps is part of the proven plan to financial fitness I promised you. They build\\non one another; therefore, if done out of order, they do not work. Think of a\\n350-pound person beginning marathon training with a quick ten-mile run.\\nThe results of not building up to that run could be total frustration at best and\\na heart attack at worst. So do the Baby Steps in order. Walk around the block\\nand lose some weight before going on a ten-mile run.\\nTo start the Baby Steps, we will work on one important step to the\\nexclusion of others. Patience! We will climb the whole mountain, but not\\nuntil we first have a strong base camp. You will be tempted to short-circuit\\nthe process because you are more concerned about one certain area of your\\nmoney, but don’t do it. These steps are the proven plan to financial fitness,\\nand they are in the right order for everyone. For example, if you are fifty-five\\nwith no retirement, you may be tempted to jump to Step Four (Invest 15\\nPercent of Your Income in Retirement), because you are scared about not\\nbeing able to retire with dignity. The paradox is that by shortcutting the', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='process, you are much more likely to fail at retiring with dignity.

The instructions are on each page, but let me give you a\\ncouple of guidelines to get started on budgeting.\\nSet up a new budget every month. Don’t try to have the perfect budget for\\nthe perfect month, because we never have those. Spend every dollar on paper\\nbefore the month begins. Give every dollar of your income a name before the\\nmonth begins, which is called a zero-based budget. Income minus outgo\\nequals zero every month. Look at this month’s income and this month’s\\nbills, savings, and debts, and match them up until you have given every\\nincome dollar an outgo name. If you have an irregular income due to\\ncommissions, self-employment, or bonuses, use the Irregular-Income Planning\\nsheet in the system to create a prioritized spending plan, but you still must do\\na written budget before each month begins.\\nIncome minus outgo equals zero every month.\\nThe financial mentality I grew up with said, “If you want anything out of life, you’re going', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='to have to get into debt for it!” And so I did. By the time I was in my mid-twenties, I had\\naccumulated $3,000 in debt on a mobile home, $9,000 in debt on a car, approximately\\n$1,000 on credit cards, and $50,000 on a newly purchased home. That’s a lot of debt to\\npay off on a salary of around $30,000 a year.\\nIt wasn’t until my cousin and her husband introduced me to Dave that I began to make\\nthe change in how I handled my money. They had attended Financial Peace University at\\na local church and decided to share the CDs with me. A few hours into the CDs, the light\\ncame on. I knew that I had to get a hold of my finances and start living life differently. I\\npurchased Financial Peace and The Total Money Makeover and began listening online to\\nDave every weekday.\\nMy most important move in becoming financially free: budgeting. I nearly passed out\\nwhen I realized how much I was spending on eating out! It took a few months to organize\\nmy funds and expenses, but now I’ve become a great budgeter! I give 10 percent of every\\npaycheck, and I’m currently allotting 49 percent of my salary to paying off my house. But\\nthanks to careful budgeting and spending, I’ll be able to assign 52 percent of my paycheck\\nto the house at the turn of the year! Then I will be able to give more and help others find\\nthe peace that I have found.\\nJaime Morgan (age 27)\\nAgriculture Communications\\nAgree on It\\nIf you’re married, agree on the budget with your spouse. This one sentence\\nrequires a stand-alone book to describe how, but the bottom line is this: if\\nyou aren’t working together, it is almost impossible to win. Once the budget\\nis agreed on and is in writing, pinky-swear and spit-shake that you will never\\ndo anything with money that is not on that paper. The paper is the boss of the\\nmoney, and you are the boss of what goes on the paper, but you have to stick\\nto the budget, or it’s just an elaborate theory.\\nIf something comes up in the middle of the month that causes the budget to\\nneed changing, call an emergency budget committee meeting. You can change\\nthe budget (and what you do with money) only if you do two things. One,\\nboth spouses agree to the change. Two, you must still balance your budget. If', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='you increase what you are spending on car repairs by $50, you must lower\\nwhat you are spending somewhere else by $50 so that your income minus\\nyour outgo still equals zero. This process of midcourse adjustment doesn’t\\nhave to be a big hairy deal, but both guidelines must be met. You still zero\\nout so you don’t blow the budget, and you get spousal approval so you\\nhaven’t broken the spit pact.\\nAdriennnne!\\nBefore we get to Baby Step One, you will have to do one other thing. You\\nwill have to be current with all your creditors. If you are behind on payments,\\nthe first goal will be to become current.

I used to do that when I first started teaching and counseling, but I\\ndiscovered that people would stop their whole Total Money Makeover\\nbecause of an emergency—they felt guilty that they had to stop debt-reducing\\nto survive. It’s like stopping your whole fitness program because you get a\\nsore knee from a fall when running; you’ll find any excuse will do.

You feel sick, like a failure.\\nSo start with a little fund to catch the little things before beginning to\\ndump the debt.

I believe with everything within me that your most powerful wealth-\\nbuilding tool is your income. Ideas, strategies, goals, vision, focus, and even\\ncreative thinking are vastly important, but until you get control and full use of\\nyour income to build wealth, you will not build and keep wealth. Some of\\nyou might inherit money or win a jackpot, but that is dumb luck, not a\\nproven plan to financial fitness. To build wealth, YOU will have to regain\\ncontrol of your income.\\nIdentify the Enemy\\nThe bottom line is that it is easy to become wealthy if you don’t have any\\npayments. You may get sick of hearing it, but the key to winning any battle\\nis to identify the enemy. The reason I am so passionate about your getting rid\\nof debt is that I have seen how many people make huge strides toward being a\\nmillionaire in the short time after they get rid of their payments. If you didn’t\\nhave a car payment, a student loan, credit cards out your ears, medical debt, or\\neven a mortgage, you could become wealthy very quickly. I know that may\\nseem like a faraway place for some of you. You might feel like a 350-pounder\\nlooking at Mr. Universe, shaking your head, thinking it will never happen for\\nyou. Let me assure you, I have walked with many 350-pounders into financial\\nfitness, so stay with me.\\nThe key to winning any battle is to identify the enemy.\\nThe math is revealing. The typical American with a $50,000 annual', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='income would normally have an $850 house payment and a $495 car\\npayment, with an additional $180 payment on the second car. Then there is a\\n$165 student-loan payment; and the average credit-card debt is about $12,000,\\nmaking those monthly payments around $185 per month. Also, this typical\\nhousehold will have other miscellaneous debt on things like furniture, stereos,\\nor personal loans on which they pay an additional $120. All these payments\\ntotal $1,995 per month. If this family were to invest that instead of sending it\\nto the creditors, they would be cash mutual-fund millionaires in just fifteen\\nyears! (After fifteen years, it gets really exciting. They’ll have $2 million in\\nfive more years, $3 million in three more years, $4 million in two and a half\\nmore years, and $5.5 million in two more years. So, they will have $5.5\\nmillion after twenty-eight years.) Keep in mind, this is with an average\\nincome, which means many of you make more than this! If you are thinking\\nthat you don’t have that many payments so your math won’t work, you\\nmissed the point. If you make $50,000 and have fewer payments, you have a\\nhead start, since you already have more control of your income than most\\npeople.\\nWith a take-home pay of $3,350, could you invest $1,995 if you had no\\npayments? All you have to pay for are utilities, food, clothes, insurance, and\\nother miscellaneous expenses. That would be tight, but doable. If you do that\\nfor just fifteen years, you will have a pinnacle experience. I will explain that\\nlater.\\nMany of you reading this are convinced that you could become wealthy if\\nyou could get out of debt. The problem now is that you are feeling more and\\nmore trapped by the debt. I have great news! I have a foolproof, but very\\ndifficult, method for getting out of debt.

The major elements of making the Debt Snowball work are\\nusing a budget, getting current before you start, smallest-to-largest payoff (no\\ncheating), sacrifice, and focused intensity. Total, sold-out, focused intensity is\\npossibly the most important. This means saying to yourself (and meaning it),\\nTo the exclusion of virtually everything else, I’m getting out of debt! If you\\ntake an old-fashioned magnifying glass outside and set it near some crumpled\\nnewspapers, nothing will happen. If you point the sun’s rays through the\\nmagnifying glass but move it around or wiggle it, nothing will happen. If you\\nhold really still and focus the sun’s rays totally on that crumpled newspaper,\\nthings begin to happen. Focused intensity will cause you to smell something\\nburning, and soon you will see an actual fire.\\nIf you think this Debt Snowball stuff is cute and you might sort of give it a', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='try, it won’t work. Total, sold-out, focused intensity is required to win.\\nAiming at the goal and nothing else is the only way to win. You have to\\nknow where you are going, and by definition know where you aren’t going, or\\nyou will never get there. I fly a lot, and I never get on a plane and think to\\nmyself, I wonder where this plane is heading? I know where I want to go,\\nand if I’m heading to New York, I stay off the plane heading to Detroit. When\\nI get off the plane, I don’t catch the first cab I see and say, “Why don’t we\\njust drive around a while because I don’t have a plan.” I tell them the hotel\\nand street where I want to go. I then ask how long that will take and what the\\nfare will be. My point is that we don’t wander aimlessly around in any other\\nparts of our lives, but we seem to think that will work with money. You can’t\\nget ready, fire, and then aim with money, and you can’t try to do six things at\\nthe same time. You are trying to get out of debt. Period. You will have to\\nfocus with great intensity to do it.\\nTo the exclusion of virtually everything else, I’m getting out of debt!\\nProverbs 6:1 and 5 (loosely Dave-paraphrased) says, “If you have signed\\nsurety, my son, [surety is Bible talk for debt] . . . deliver yourself like the\\nbird from the hand of the fowler and the gazelle from the hand of the hunter.” I\\nremember reading that Bible verse in my daily Bible study one day and\\nthinking what a cute little animal metaphor it was for getting out of debt.\\nThen one day later that week I was surfing channels and hit the Discovery\\nChannel. I noticed they were filming gazelles. The gazelles were peacefully\\ngazelling around. Of course, you know the Discovery Channel wasn’t there\\njust for the gazelles. The next camera shot was of Mr. Cheetah sneaking up in\\nthe bushes looking for lunch in all the right places. Suddenly, one of the\\ngazelles got a whiff of Mr. Cheetah and became very aware of his plan. The\\nother gazelles noticed the alarm and soon also were on edge. They couldn’t\\nyet see the cheetah, so out of fear of running at him, they froze until he played\\nhis cards.\\nRealizing he had been discovered, Mr. Cheetah decided to give it his best\\nshot and leaped from the bushes.

As a matter\\nof fact, the cheetah only gets his gazelle burger for lunch in one out of nineteen\\nchases.

Just to be\\nable to make small accomplishments made a tremendous amount of difference. It\\ncontinuously gave me hope throughout this process. Granted, I did not have or earn a lot\\nof money to put toward becoming debt-free. But I think that made it all the more\\nincredible. I knew I just had to make it work. The ability to become debt-free isn’t\\ncontingent upon a certain income.

When some people do their\\nbudget, there is barely enough to make all the minimum payments and\\nnothing extra to pay on the smallest. There is no push to get the Snowball\\nrolling. Let me offer another image to help you better understand this problem\\nand the solution. My great-great-grandfather ran a timber operation in the hills\\nof Kentucky and West Virginia. In that bygone era, after cutting the timber,\\nthey would put the logs into the river to float them downstream to the\\nsawmill. The logs would build up at a bend in the river, and a traffic jam of\\nwood occurred. This would continue as long as the jammed-up area stopped\\nthe progress of the other logs. Sometimes the loggers could break the jam\\nloose by pushing the logs. Other times they would have to get radical before a\\nreal mess occurred.\\nDave Rants...\\nRemember, just because one of you is keeping the checkbook, this does not mean that this\\nperson makes all the financial decisions.\\nWhen it got bad, they would break the logjam by throwing dynamite into\\nthe middle of the logs that were blocking the progress. As you can imagine,\\nthis created a dramatic effect. When the dynamite blew, logs and pieces of logs\\nwould fly into the air. After working so hard to cut the trees, some of them\\nwere a total loss. They had to blow up some of the timber to get the rest of\\nthe crop to market. That’s the sacrifice the situation required. Sometimes that', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='is what you have to do with the stopped-up budget. You have to dynamite it.\\nYou have to get radical to get the money flowing again.\\nOne way to do that is to sell something. You could sell lots of little stuff at\\na garage sale, sell a seldom-used item on the Internet, or sell a precious item\\nthrough the classifieds. Get gazelle-intense and sell so much stuff that the kids\\nare afraid they are next. Sell things that make your broke friends question your\\nsanity. If your budget is stopped-up and your Debt Snowball won’t roll on its\\nown, you are going to have to get radical.\\nIn watching heroes across the nation get out of debt with gazelle intensity,\\nbelieve me, I have seen them sell things. One lady sold 350 goldfish from her\\npond for a dollar apiece. Men have sold their Harleys, boats, knife collections,\\nor baseball cards. Ladies have sold precious things like nonfamily antiques\\n(keep the heirlooms because you can’t get them back) or a personal car they\\nthought was necessary to life on the planet. I don’t recommend selling your\\nhome unless you have payments above 45 percent of your monthly take-home\\npay. Usually, the home isn’t the problem. I do recommend that most people\\nsell the car with the most debt on it. A good rule of thumb on items (except\\nthe house) is this: if you can’t be debt-free on it (not counting the home) in\\neighteen to twenty months, sell it. If you have a car or a boat that you can’t\\npay off in eighteen to twenty months, sell it. It is just a car; dynamite the\\nlogjam! I used to love my car, too, but I found keeping that huge debt while\\ntrying to get out of debt was like running a race wearing ankle weights.

The Debt Snowball,\\nor stop and go back to Baby Step One (save $1,000)? Penny needs to put the\\nDebt Snowball temporarily on hold. She will continue to make minimum\\npayments and go back to the first step until she gets back up to $1,000 in her\\nemergency fund.

Generally speaking, if your second mortgage is more than 50\\npercent of your gross annual income, you should not put it in the Debt\\nSnowball. We will get to it later.

If\\nyou own several, or even just one, rental property, you should consider\\nselling some or all to get the money to pay off the ones you keep or pay off\\nother debt listed in the Debt Snowball. Having $40,000 in credit-card debt\\nand a rental with $40,000 equity doesn’t make sense. You wouldn’t borrow\\n$40,000 on credit cards to buy a rental, I hope.

The worst time to borrow is when times are bad. If\\nthere is a recession and you lose your job (read, “no income”), you don’t\\nwant to have a bunch of debt. In a recent Gallup poll, 56 percent of Americans\\nsaid they would borrow on a credit card if a rainy day came, and it wouldn’t\\nbe difficult. I agree it wouldn’t be difficult because credit cards are issued to\\ndogs and dead people every year, but that doesn’t mean it would be smart.\\nWhat would be difficult is to make the payments and even pay off the debt if\\nyou don’t get that new replacement job. A Country Financial Security Index\\nsurvey found that 49 percent of Americans could cover less than one month’s\\nexpenses if they lost their income. Half of this culture has virtually no buffer\\nbetween them and life. Here comes Murphy! Remember how we discussed\\nthat problems seem to be (and I believe actually are) less frequent when you\\nhave your fully funded emergency fund? Don’t forget that the emergency fund\\nactually acts as Murphy repellent.\\nSo, what is an emergency anyway? An emergency is something you had no\\nway of knowing was coming, something that has a major impact on you and\\nyour family if you don’t cover it. Emergencies include paying the deductible\\non medical, homeowner’s, or car insurance after an accident, a job loss or\\ncutback, medical bills resulting from an accident or unforeseen medical\\nproblem, or a blown transmission or engine in a car that you need to function.\\nAll of these are emergencies.

I use growth-stock mutual funds for long-term investing, but I\\nwould never put my emergency fund there. If my car engine blew, I would be\\ntempted to borrow to fix it rather than cash in my mutual fund because the\\nmarket is down (we always want to wait on it to go back up). That means I\\nhave the emergency fund in the wrong place.

The exception to this is if you can get some kind of “quick-\\nrelease” CD that allows one withdrawal during the committed period without\\npenalty.

That is a sensitive place\\nin her psyche, and with good reason. We don’t even use the emergency fund\\nfor emergencies.

Guys, this can be a wonderful gift to your wife.\\nAn Emergency Fund Can Turn Crises into Inconveniences\\nAs you budget over the years and your Total Money Makeover completely\\nchanges your money habits, you will use the emergency fund less and less.\\nWe haven’t touched our emergency fund in over fifteen years. When we first\\nstarted, everything was an emergency. But as you crawl off the bottom, and\\nThe Total Money Makeover begins to take effect, you have fewer things you\\ncan’t cover in your monthly budget. At the start, though, you’ll be like we\\nwere—everything will be an emergency. To show you what I mean, consider\\ntwo different stories of people at two different places in the Baby Steps.\\nKim was twenty-three, single, on her own, and at a job making $27,000\\nper year. She recently started her Total Money Makeover. She was behind on\\ncredit cards, not on a budget, and barely making her rent because her spending\\nwas out of control. She let her car insurance drop because she “couldn’t afford\\nit.” She did her first budget and two days later was in a car wreck. Since it\\nwasn’t bad, the damage to the other guy’s car was only about $550. As Kim\\nlooked at me through panicked tears, that $550 might as well have been\\n$55,000. She hadn’t even started Baby Step One. She was trying to get\\ncurrent, and now she had one more hurdle to clear before she even started.\\nThis was a huge emergency.\\nSeven years ago, George and Sally were in the same place. They were broke\\nwith new babies, and George’s career was sputtering. George and Sally fought\\nand scraped through a Total Money Makeover. Today they are debt-free, even\\ntheir $85,000 home. They have a $12,000 emergency fund, retirement in Roth', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='IRAs, and even the kids’ college is funded. George has grown personally, his\\ncareer has blossomed, and he now makes $75,000 per year while Sally stays\\nhome with the kids. One day, a piece of trash flew out of the back of George’s\\npickup and hit a car behind him on the interstate. The damage was about\\n$550.\\nI think you can see that George and Sally will probably adjust one month’s\\nbudget and pay the repairs while Kim will deal with her wreck for months.\\nThe point is that as you get in better shape, it takes a lot more to rock your\\nworld. When the accidents occurred, George’s heart rate didn’t even change,\\nbut Kim needed a Valium sandwich to calm down.\\nThose true stories illustrate the fact that as you progress through your Total\\nMoney Makeover, the definition of an emergency that is worthy to be covered\\nby the emergency fund changes. As you have better health insurance,\\ndisability insurance, more room in your budget, and better cars, you will have\\nfewer things that qualify as emergency-fund emergencies.\\nWhat used to be a huge, life-altering event will become a mere\\ninconvenience. When you are debt-free and aggressively investing to become\\nwealthy, taking a few months off from investing will put a new engine in a\\ncar. When I say the emergency fund is Murphy-repellent, that is only partially\\ncorrect. The reality is that Murphy doesn’t visit as much, but when he does\\nwe hardly notice his presence. When Sharon and I were broke, our heating-\\nand-air system quit, and the repair cost $580. It was a huge, hairy deal.\\nRecently I had a new $570 water heater installed because the old one started\\nleaking, and I hardly noticed. I wonder if the stress relief that your Total\\nMoney Makeover provides will allow you to live longer?\\nWhat used to be a huge, life-altering event will become a mere inconvenience.\\nLet Me Be Perfectly Clear\\nThere are some Baby Step Three clarifications.

Should these people work on\\ndebt or finish the emergency fund? All three should temporarily stop\\nSnowballing and concentrate on the emergency fund because we can see\\ndistant storm clouds that are real. Once the storm passes, they can resume the\\nplan as before.\\nResuming the plan for Joe means that once the babies are born healthy, are\\nhome, and everyone is fine, Joe will take the emergency fund back down to\\n$1,000 by using the rest of the savings to pay the Debt Snowball. Resuming\\nfor Brad would mean that once he finds his new job, he’ll do the same. Mike\\nshould hold his instant emergency fund of $25,000 until he is reemployed.\\nThe sooner he can get a job, the more that severance is going to look like a\\nbonus and have a huge impact on the Debt Snowball.\\nSometimes people think they don’t need an emergency fund because their\\nincome is guaranteed.

If you can\\nlive with dignity on $40,000, you need a nest egg of only $500,000.

If we did, we’d see that failure and\\nheartache are guaranteed—if we expect a college degree by itself to deliver\\nlife’s treasures. Only if you mix knowledge with attitude, character,\\nperseverance, vision, diligence, and extreme levels of work will your college\\ndegree produce for you.

I have been a millionaire starting with nothing two times\\nbefore I was forty, and I attribute 15 percent of that to college knowledge and 0\\npercent to the degree. The book Emotional Intelligence reported a similar\\nfinding. In studying successful people, the author discovered that 15 percent of\\nsuccess could be attributed to training and education, while 85 percent was\\nattributed to attitude, perseverance, diligence, and vision.

Find out\\nwhat the private, smaller, more intimate college costs. Compare them. In\\nsome areas of study and in a very few careers, where you graduate from will\\nmatter, but in most it won’t. Pedigree means less and less in our work culture\\ntoday. How can you justify going into debt $75,000 for a degree when you\\ncould have gone to a state school and paid for it out of your pocket debt-free?\\nYou can’t.

Otherwise,\\nreconsider.\\nThe first rule of college (whether for you or for your children) is: pay cash.\\nThe second rule is: if you have the cash or the scholarship, go.

Savings bonds won’t work either (sorry,\\nGrandma!) because they average about 5 percent. Most states now offer prepaid\\ncollege tuition. We discussed that in Chapter 4 on Money Myths, but\\nremember that when you prepay anything, you simply break even with\\ninflation on that item.

That is not too bad, but keep in mind\\nthat a decent growth-stock mutual fund will average over 12 percent when\\ninvested long-term.

If you invest $2,000 a year from birth to\\nage eighteen in prepaid tuition, that would purchase about $72,000 in tuition,', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='but through an ESA in mutual funds averaging 12 percent, you would have\\n$126,000 tax-free. The ESA currently allows you to invest $2,000 per year,\\nper child, if your household income is under $220,000 per year. If you start\\ninvesting early, your child can go to virtually any college if you save $166.67\\nper month ($2,000/year). For most of you, Baby Step Five is handled if you\\nstart an ESA fully funded and your child is under eight.\\nIf your children are older, or you have aspirations of expensive schools,\\ngraduate school, or PhD programs that you pay for, you will have to save\\nmore than the ESA will allow.

There are several\\ntypes of 529 plans, and you should stay away from most of them. The first\\ntype to become popular was the “life phase” plan. This type of plan allows\\nthe plan administrator to control your money and move it to more\\nconservative investments as the child ages. These perform poorly (at about 8\\npercent) because they are very conservative. The next type is a “fixed\\nportfolio” plan, which sets a fixed percentage of your investment in a group of\\nmutual funds and locks you in until you need the money. You can’t move the\\nmoney, so if you get into some stinky funds, you’re stuck with them.

Two, most\\npeople believe all the mortgage myths that have been spread. Yes, we must\\ndispel a few more myths. There are two really big “reasons” that keep\\nseemingly intelligent people (like me for years) from paying off mortgages, so\\nwe will start with those.\\nRemember, Beware of the Myths\\nBig Reason Number One:\\nMyth: It is wise to keep my home mortgage to get the tax deduction.\\nTruth: Tax deductions are no bargain.', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='We discussed tax-deduction math when we looked at car fleeces. Let’s\\nreview. If you have a home with a payment of around $900, and the interest\\nportion is $830 per month, you have paid around $10,000 in interest that\\nyear, which creates a tax deduction. If, instead, you have a debt-free home, you\\nwould, in fact, lose the tax deduction, so the myth says to keep your home\\nmortgaged because of tax advantages.\\nThis situation is one more opportunity to discover if your CPA can add. If\\nyou do not have a $10,000 tax deduction and you are in a 30 percent bracket,\\nyou will have to pay $3,000 in taxes on that $10,000. According to the myth,\\nwe should send $10,000 in interest to the bank so we don’t have to send\\n$3,000 in taxes to the IRS. Personally, I think I will live debt-free and not\\nmake a $10,000 trade for $3,000. However, any of you who want $3,000 of\\nyour taxes paid, just e-mail me and I will personally pay $3,000 of your taxes\\nas soon as your check for $10,000 clears into my bank account. I can add.\\nBig Reason Number Two:\\nMyth: It is wise to borrow all I can on my home (or continually\\nrefinance for cash out) because of the great interest rates; then I\\ncan invest the money.\\nTruth: You really don’t make anything when the smoke clears.\\nThis one is a little complicated, but if you follow me, you will have\\nintellectually grasped why so many people have fallen into a financial pit. The\\nmyth that I was taught in academia (I am not against higher learning, by the\\nway, as long as we are learning the truth) is to use lower-interest debt to\\ninvest in higher-return investments. Sadly, some “Financial Planners” have\\ntold Americans to borrow on their homes at around 8 percent to invest in\\ngood growth-stock mutual funds averaging 12 percent because you make an', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='easy 4 percent spread.\\nMutual funds are awesome investments, and as I have said, I personally\\nhave tons of money invested in good growth-stock mutual funds. Also, the\\nstock market has averaged around 12 percent from the beginning. Some years\\nare great and some are lousy, and we have had both in the last ten years, but\\nthe long-term average is around 12 percent. So I buy and recommend mutual\\nfunds.\\nThe problem with this myth is that the assumptions used to get to that 4\\npercent spread or profit on investing are wrong. Mythsayers, and I have been\\none, are very naïve in how they approach investing.\\nLet’s look at borrowing $100,000 on your home to invest. If you borrowed\\nat 8 percent, you would pay $8,000 in interest, and if you invested the\\n$100,000 you borrowed on your home and made 12 percent, you would make\\n$12,000 in return, netting you $4,000. Or would you? Where I live, if you\\nmake $12,000 on an investment, you will pay taxes. If you are in a 30 percent\\nbracket, you will pay $3,600 in taxes at ordinary income rates or $2,400 if\\nyou invest at capital gains rates. So you will not net $4,000, but instead $400\\nto $1,600. But we aren’t through yet.\\nIf I own the home next to you and have no debt, and you (because of your\\ninvestment adviser guy) borrowed $100,000 on your home, who has taken\\nmore risk? When the economy moves south, when there is war or rumors of\\nwar, when you get sick or have a car wreck or are downsized, you will run\\ninto major problems with a $100,000 mortgage that I will never have. So\\ndebt causes risk to increase.\\nI can prove to you that risk increases. With the drop in real estate values\\nand the slowing market in the 2008–09 recession, many people lost their\\nhomes to foreclosure. I have done in-depth, detailed research and have found\\nthat 100 percent of the foreclosed homes had a mortgage. Ha! Sadly, some of\\nthe people who lost their homes had a naïve financial planner who left risk out\\nof his formula and suggested they “harvest” their equity. Like I said earlier,\\n“When the tide goes out, you can tell who was skinny-dipping.”', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='Since debt causes increased risk, we must mathematically factor in a\\nreduction in return if we are sophisticated investors. If you can make 12\\npercent on a mutual fund, and I try to get you to invest in a bet on the roulette\\nwheel, which will return you 500 percent, you would automatically say the\\ntwo don’t compare. Why? Risk. Common sense tells you not to compare\\nmutual funds and roulette wheel returns without adjusting the returns for risk.\\nCommon sense tells you to discount the 500 percent upside of the roulette\\nwheel because of risk. After discounting the roulette wheel for risk, you would\\nrather have the mutual fund. Good choice.\\nKnow where you are weak, and take action to make sure you don’t fall prey to the\\nweakness.\\nActually this is done in academia as well. There is a statistical measure of\\nrisk called a beta. A big beta means a big risk. Graduate-level financial people\\nwho are taught mathematical formulas to make risky investments compare\\napples to apples with safer investments after adjustment for risk. We just never\\napply that formula to a debt-free home versus a mortgaged and invested home,\\nwhich is very naïve. The technical formula is great for putting you to sleep,\\nbut understand that you can’t compare risk with no risk unless you make\\nadjustments.\\nThe bottom line is that after adjusting for taxes and risk, you don’t make\\nmoney on our little formula.

A big part of\\nbeing strong financially is that you know where you are weak and take action\\nto make sure you don’t fall prey to the weakness. And we ALL are weak.\\nSick children, bad transmissions, prom dresses, high heat bills, and dog\\nvaccinations come up, and you won’t make the extra payment.

The math shows that you don’t save enough on\\ninterest rates to pay yourself back for the points. When you pay points you are\\nprepaying interest, and it takes an average of about ten years to get your\\nmoney back. The Mortgage Bankers Association says the average life of a\\nmortgage is only about three to five years, so on average you don’t save\\nenough to get your money back before you pay the loan off by moving or\\nrefinancing. When refinancing, ask for a “par” quote, which means zero points\\nand zero origination fee. The mortgage broker can make a profit by selling the\\nloan; they don’t need the origination fee to be profitable.\\nMyth: It is wise to use the lower rates offered by an ARM mortgage\\nor balloon mortgage if you know you’ll “be moving in a few\\nyears anyway.”\\nTruth: You will be moving when they foreclose.\\nThe ARM, Adjustable Rate Mortgage, was invented in the early 1980s.\\nPrior to that, those of us in the real estate business sold fixed-rate 7 or 8', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='percent mortgages. What happened? I was there in the middle of that disaster\\nof an economy when fixed-rate mortgages went as high as 17 percent and the\\nreal estate world froze. Lenders paid out 12 percent on CDs but had money\\nloaned out at 7 percent on hundreds of millions of dollars in mortgages. They\\nwere losing money, and lenders don’t like to lose money. So the Adjustable\\nRate Mortgage was born, in which your interest rate goes up when the\\nprevailing market interest rates go up. The ARM was born to transfer the risk\\nof higher interest rates to you, the consumer. In the last several years, home\\nmortgage rates have been at a thirty-year low. It is not wise to get something\\nthat adjusts when you are at the bottom of rates!

Balloons pop, and it is always strange\\nto me that the popping sound is so startling. Why don’t we expect it? It is in\\nthe very nature of balloons to pop.

Ed is a very sophisticated financial guy, or\\nso he thought, so he had a HEL for emergencies. Sally had a bad car wreck,\\nand within three months Ed got downsized. They quickly went through the\\nHEL and then got behind in their bills. The annual renewal came up on the\\nHEL, and the bank chose not to renew their loan because of their bad credit,\\nwhich had been perfect for the previous seventeen years of marriage. The bank\\ncalled the note. Ed couldn’t believe the bank would kick them when they\\nwere down. The note being called meant they had to refinance to pay off the\\nbank, but guess what? They couldn’t because their credit was bad. The end\\nresult was very sad; they sold their home to avoid a foreclosure. Ed was\\nwrong. They should have had an emergency fund instead of a loan.\\nMyth: You can’t pay cash for a home!\\nTruth: Bet me.\\nFirst, let me tell you that mortgage debt is the only kind of debt I don’t\\nyell about.

They lived on nothing, did nothing that cost money, and they saved.\\nMan, did they save! Making $80,000 in the household, they saved $50,000 a\\nyear for three years and paid cash for a $150,000 home. They closed on the\\nhome on Luke’s wife’s twenty-sixth birthday.

The monkey can’t take his hand out of\\nthe bottle without dropping the nuts, which he is unwilling to do.

The project is drug-infested and\\ncrime-riddled, but for one day a year, those young people see someone who\\nwants nothing in return.\\nAnother pastor friend of mine is involved in a project called Seeds of\\nKindness. An anonymous member of his congregation gave $50,000 to the\\ncongregation members to give away, one $100 bill at a time. The member\\nmust not use the gift, the member must receive nothing in return, and it\\nshould be given as personally as possible. These $100 bills are given human\\nto human across the city with fabulous results. People who had completely\\nlost faith in God and in the human race are shaken to the core by a simple\\n$100 gift. The givers often report having more fun than the receivers.\\nSecret Santa\\nWe all have seen these powerful examples of giving. USA Today followed a\\nguy who called himself Secret Santa at Christmas for several years. Secret\\nSanta walked the streets around Christmastime and gave away $100 bills.\\nNothing required, nothing expected. Sometimes he gave to people in need,\\nand other times he just gave. Every year he gave away around $25,000 in\\n$100 bills. He started this tradition years ago in his hometown of Kansas City\\nand moved out across America. He gave in New York after 9/11 and in the\\nVirginia/Washington, D.C., area after the sniper attacks. He just walked\\naround and handed people $100 bills. He got some fabulous reactions and\\nheard some wonderful stories.\\nIn late winter of 1971, he worked as a salesman, and when his company\\nwent broke, Santa found himself broke too. He had slept in his car for eight', metadata={'source': 'book5'}), Document(page_content='days and hadn’t eaten for two days when he went to the Dixie Diner. He\\nordered and ate a big breakfast. He waited for the crowd to clear, then acted as\\nif he had lost his wallet. The diner’s owner, Tom Horn, who was also the\\ncook, came over near the stool where Santa had been sitting and picked up a\\n$20 bill and said, “Son, you must have dropped this.” Santa realized later\\nthat Tom had planted that twenty to let him out of a sticky situation with his\\ndignity intact. As he drove away, Santa said, “Thank You, Lord, for that\\nman, and I promise if I ever have money, I will do the same.”\\nIn 1999, Santa, now a very successful businessman, looked up Tom Horn,\\nnow eighty-five years old, in his home of Tupelo, Mississippi. Santa\\nrecounted the story of the hungry young man of 1971 while standing on\\nTom’s porch in a Santa hat. He asked Tom what he thought that $20 would\\nbe worth by that time and Tom laughingly said, “Probably $10,000.” Santa\\nthen handed Tom $10,000 cash in an envelope. Of course, Tom tried to hand\\nit back, but finally Santa won out, so Tom deposited the money in the bank.\\nHe said he might need it to take care of his wife, who has Alzheimer’s.\\nHorn said of Secret Santa, “He doesn’t want any thanks or praise for what\\nhe does. He does it out of the goodness of his heart.” After giving to dozens of\\npeople a few Christmases ago, Santa said, “Isn’t it fun to lift people up and\\nsee the smiles on their faces?” I think I know why this Santa gave. He gave\\nbecause it is the most fun he can possibly have with money, and you will\\nnever know until you try.\\nA few years ago Secret Santa’s identity was revealed. He was Larry Stewart\\nfrom Kansas City. Larry had revealed his identity because, after giving away\\nover $1.3 million, he had been diagnosed with cancer.

This is a book about getting out of debt and into wealth.\\nHowever, there is a problem with following The Total Money Makeover plan.\\nThe problem is simply that it’s a “proven plan” because it works. If you\\nfollow this system, it will work. It will work so well that you are going to\\nbecome wealthy over the next twenty to forty years. The problem with\\nbecoming wealthy is that you stand a chance of becoming enamored with\\nwealth.

If all you get from your wealth is the wrong view of it, wealth will\\ndestroy your peace. If you get from your wealth the idea that you are some big\\ndeal because you gathered some money, you missed the essence of a Total\\nMoney Makeover. The wealthy person who is ruled by his stuff is no more\\nfree than the debt-ridden consumer we have picked on throughout the book.\\nAntoine Rivaroli said, “There are men who gain from their wealth only the\\nfear of losing it.”\\nSince you have read many pages learning a wealth-building system from\\nme, you might think that I believe stuff is the answer to happiness, emotional\\nwell-being, and spiritual maturity.

The danger is old-fashioned materialism. In his great book Money,\\nPossessions, and Eternity, author Randy Alcorn takes a probing look at\\nmaterialism. Randy discusses a disease running amuck in America:\\n“Affluenza.” Affluenza is a malady that affects some of the affluent and their\\nchildren. Because some of the affluent and their children seek happiness,\\nsolace, and fulfillment in the consuming of stuff, they face a problem. By\\ntrying to get stuff to do something it wasn’t designed to do, they come up\\nempty and end up depressed and even suicidal. They discover bumper-sticker\\nwisdom: “He who dies with the most toys is still dead.” Stuff is wonderful;\\nget some stuff, but don’t let the pursuit of wealth become your god.\\nMy wife and I are concerned that our wealth be a blessing and not a curse to\\nour children.

They, like their parents, aren’t\\nperfect, but they are doing well. When one of my kids was a teenager, she\\ncomplained to me, “Do you know how tough it is being Dave Ramsey’s\\nkid? Dad, you are so hard on us, making us buy our own cars, manage our\\nown checkbooks. You cut us no slack.” I replied that we are tough on them\\nbecause one day they will inherit our wealth, and that wealth will either ruin\\ntheir lives or become a tool for great good.\\nMy kids, you, and I can have good things happen as a result of our Total\\nMoney Makeover only if we have the spiritual character to recognize that\\nwealth is not the answer to life’s questions. We further must recognize that\\nwhile wealth is very fun, it comes with great responsibility.\\nAnother paradox is that wealth will make you more of what you are. Let\\nthat one soak in for a minute. If you are a jerk and you become wealthy, you\\nwill be king of the jerks. If you are generous and you become wealthy, you\\nwill be most generous. If you are kind, wealth will allow you to show\\nkindness in immeasurable ways.

Many of the heroes of biblical faith, of world\\nhistory, and of our nation were very wealthy, including King David,\\nSolomon, Job, and most of our Founding Fathers. There is a negative mind-\\nset justifying money mediocrity that is maddening. Wealth is not evil, and\\npeople who possess it aren’t evil by virtue of the wealth. There are rich jerks\\nand poor jerks. Dallas Willard, in his book The Spirit of the Disciplines, says\\nto use riches is to cause them to be consumed, to trust in riches is to count\\nupon them for things they cannot provide, but to possess riches is to have the\\nright to say how they will or will not be used.\\nTo possess riches is to have the right to say how they will or will not be used.\\nIf you are a good person, it is your spiritual duty to possess riches for the\\ngood of mankind. If you are a Christian like me, it is your spiritual duty to\\npossess riches so that you can do with them things that bring glory to God.\\nThe bottom line is, if you take the stand that managing wealth is evil or\\ncarnal, then by default you leave all the wealth to the evil, carnal people. If\\nwealth is spiritually bad, then good people can’t have it, so all the bad people\\nget it. It is the duty of the good people to get wealth to keep it from the bad\\npeople, because the good people will do good with it.

If you are self-employed or work on\\ncommission or royalties, then planning your expenses is difficult, since you\\ncannot always predict your income. You should still do all the sheets except\\nthe Allocated-Spending Plan. The Monthly Cash-Flow Plan will tell you\\nwhat you have to earn monthly to survive or prosper, and those real numbers\\nare very good for goal setting.\\nWhat you must do is take the items on the Monthly Cash-Flow Plan and\\nprioritize them by importance. I repeat: by importance, not urgency. You\\nshould ask yourself, If I only have enough money to pay one thing, what\\nwould that be? Then ask, If I only have enough money to pay one more thing,\\nwhat would that be? Move this way through the list. Now be prepared to\\nstand your ground because things have a way of seeming important that are\\nonly urgent. Saving should be a high priority!\\nThe third column, \"Cumulative Amount,\" is the total of all amounts above\\nthat item.

She wanted to know if the millionaire market is\\ndead given the recent reversals in the market value of stocks and homes. I replied that the millionaire\\nnext door is still alive and kicking even today in this recession. Since 1980 I have consistently found\\nthat most millionaires do not have all of their wealth tied up in their stock portfolios or in their homes.\\nOne of the reasons that millionaires are economically successful is that they think differently. Many a\\nmillionaire has told me that true diversity has much to do with controlling one’s investments; no one\\ncan control the stock market. But you can, for example, control your own business, private\\ninvestments, and money you lend to private parties. Not at any time during the past thirty years have I\\nfound that the typical millionaire had more than 30 percent of his wealth invested in publicly traded\\nstocks. More often it is in the low-to-mid-20-percent range. These percentages are consistent with\\nthose found in studies conducted by the Internal Revenue Service, which has the best data set on\\nmillionaires in the world.\\nConsider the profile of a millionaire-next-door-type couple, Ms. T and her husband. To most, this\\ncouple’s lifestyle is boring, even common. This millionaire’s brand of watch is a Timex; her\\nhusband’s is a Seiko (number one among millionaires). The couple buys their clothes at Dillard’s, J.C.\\nPenney, and TJ Maxx. They have purchased only two motor vehicles in the past 10 years: both Fords.\\nThe current market value of their home is approximately $275,000. Ms. T’s most recent haircut cost\\n$18. Yet they are uncommon in the sense that they are financially independent.\\nWhen I speak of people like Ms. T and her husband, invariably someone will ask: “But are they\\nhappy?” Fully 90 percent of millionaires who live in homes valued at under $300,000 are extremely\\nsatisfied with life. And, in my most recent work, I state that there are nearly three times as many\\nhouseholds with investments of $1 million or more living in homes valued at $300,000 or less than\\nthere are living in homes valued at $1 million or more.\\nEven most multimillionaires in America don’t live in expensive homes. I recently tabulated the\\n2007 IRS estate data (the latest data available) for those decedents with an estate valued at $3.5\\nmillion or more. I estimated that the median market value of a decedent’s home was $469,021, or less\\nthan 10 percent of their median net worth. On average these decedents had more than two-and-one-\\nhalf times more of their wealth invested in investment real estate than in their own personal homes.\\nProfiling the millionaire next door population was a cumulative process which continues today.\\nOriginally I used a different description to define this segment. I first coined the “wealthy blue collar”\\nsegment in a paper entitled “Market Segmentation: Utilizing Investment Determinants,” which I\\npresented on October 10, 1979 at a conference of the Securities Industry Association in New York\\nCity. The paper was later published by the American Marketing Association. Earlier in May 1979, the\\nNew York Stock Exchange had asked me to develop a set of marketing implications and\\nrecommendations based upon its then recently completed national survey of 2,741 households on\\ninvestment patterns and attitudes and behaviors about money. This provided a base for the above-\\nmentioned paper. A key point I made in this paper was:\\nopportunities exist in segments that the [investment] industry has ignored for years….', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='[Members of] the really big segment, the wealthy blue collar, do not need to purchase\\nexpensive artifacts that are part of the white collar workers’ knapsack….\\nAt the time of my presentation I realized that the blue-collar/millionaire next door segment did\\nexist, and it was likely to be a sizable one. Not long after I first idenrified this marker, I discovered\\nhow very large it indeed was.\\nIn June 1980 I was asked by a large money center bank to conduct a national study of the\\nmillionaire population in America. During the planning stage, an event took place which had a major\\ninfluence upon the direction of my career I encountered my epiphany about the millionaire-next-door\\nsegment one morning at a task force meeting with my client and a colleague and friend, Jon Robbin.\\nJon is a Harvard-trained mathematician who profiled the wealth characteristics of the residents within\\neach of more than 200,000 neighborhoods across America. He said, in passing, “About one-half of the\\nmillionaires in America don’t live in upscale neighborhoods.” That’s when the light went on inside\\nmy head! The really compelling story was not the millionaire population in general. Rather it was the\\nlow-profile millionaires, the ones who lived in modest homes situated in middle-class, even working-\\nclass neighborhoods. From that moment on, I intensely began studying and writing about the\\nmillionaire-next-door types. The research that I conducted thirty years ago in 1980 was the first\\ncomprehensive national study about the size, geographic distribution, and financial lifestyles of\\nmillionaires. The key findings were highly congruent with the numerous studies that I have conducted\\nsince that time.\\nI authored “The National Affluent Study 1981-1982” for a consortium of the top fifty financial\\ninstitutions in America. In addition to designing this study, I traveled the country conducting focus\\ngroup interviews with millionaires. Later, many of these financial institutions, including seven of the\\ntop ten trust companies in America, asked me to conduct focus group interviews and surveys of the\\naffluent on their behalf. As a result, I had the opportunity to meet with more than 500 millionaires\\nface to face. My interpretation of these interviews as well as many others that I conducted is given\\nthroughout The Millionaire Next Door. Interestingly, the millionaires I interviewed in Oklahoma and\\nTexas, for example, had the same set of traditional American values as those whom I interviewed in\\nNew York City and Chicago. The large majority was keenly interested in being financially\\nindependent. That’s why they lived below their means.\\nPrior to writing The Millionaire Next Door, I spent nearly an entire year reviewing my survey data\\nand the transcripts of the interviews conducted between 1982 and 1996. This extensive research and\\nanalysis, I believe, is what makes The Millionaire Next Door a perennial best seller. For the price of a\\nbook, the reader is essentially buying the equivalent of more than $1 million worth of invaluable\\nresearch and interpretation.\\nWhy do I continue to write about rich people? It is not for the benefit of rich people! What I write is\\ndesigned to enlighten those who are confused and misinformed about what it means to be rich. Most\\nAmericans have no idea about the true inner workings of a wealthy household. The advertising\\nindustry and Hollywood have done a wonderful job conditioning us to believe that wealth and\\nhyperconsumption go hand in hand. Yet, as I have said many times, the large majority of the rich live\\nwell below their means. Unfortunately, most Americans think that they are emulating the rich by\\nimmediately consuming any upward swing in their cash flow.\\nBut the millionaire-next-door types do it differently. As one millionaire woman trained as an\\nengineer told me, “After college my husband (also an engineer) and I both got good jobs. We lived on\\none income and saved the other. Anytime we got raises we just saved more. We have lived in the same\\nmodest 1,900-square-foot home for twenty years…. Sometimes my kids ask if we are poor because I', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='make them order from the $1 value menu.”\\nAmerica is still the land of opportunity. Over the past thirty years I have consistently found that 80\\nto 85 percent of millionaires are self-made. There is great pride, joy and satisfaction to be derived\\nfrom building one’s own fortune. Countless millionaires have told me that the journey to wealth is\\nmuch more satisfying than the destination. When they look back over their history of building wealth,\\nthey recall constantly setting economic goals and the great happiness gained from achieving them.\\nYes, in the context of economic achievement, it is the trip, the journey to financial independence\\nabout which the millionaires next door most often boast.\\nThomas J. Stanley, Ph.D.\\nJune 2010\\nAtlanta, Georgia\\nVisit Dr. Stanley at www.thomasjstanley.com', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='T\\nwenty years ago we began studying how people become wealthy. Initially, we did it just as you\\nmight imagine, by surveying people in so-called upscale neighborhoods across the country. In time,\\nwe discovered something odd. Many people who live in expensive homes and drive luxury cars do not\\nactually have much wealth. Then, we discovered something even odder: Many people who have a\\ngreat deal of wealth do not even live in upscale neighborhoods.\\nThat small insight changed our lives. It led one of us, Tom Stanley, out of an academic career,\\ninspired him to write three books on marketing to the affluent in America, and made him an advisor to\\ncorporations that provide products and services to the affluent. In addition, he conducted research\\nabout the affluent for seven of the top ten financial service corporations in America. Between us, we\\nhave conducted hundreds of seminars on the topic of targeting the wealthy.\\nWhy are so many people interested in what we have to say? Because we have discovered who the\\nwealthy really are and who they are not. And, most important, we have determined how ordinary\\npeople can become wealthy.\\nWhat is so profound about these discoveries? Just this: Most people have it all wrong about wealth\\nin America. Wealth is not the same as income. If you make a good income each year and spend it all,\\nyou are not getting wealthier. You are just living high. Wealth is what you accumulate, not what you\\nspend.\\nHow do you become wealthy? Here, too, most people have it wrong. It is seldom luck or inheritance\\nor advanced degrees or evenintelligence that enables people to amass fortunes. Wealth is more often\\nthe result of a lifestyle of hard work, perseverance, planning, and, most of all, self-discipline.\\nHow come I am not wealthy?\\nMany people ask this question of themselves all the time. Often they are hard-working, well-\\neducated, high-income people. Why, then, are so few affluent?', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='MILLIONAIRES AND YOU\\nThere has never been more personal wealth in America than there is today (over $22 trillion in 1996).\\nYet most Americans are not wealthy. Nearly one-half of our wealth is owned by 3.5 percent of our\\nhouseholds. Most of the other households don’t even come close. By “other households,” we are not\\nreferring to economic dropouts. Most of these millions of households are composed of people who\\nearn moderate, even high, incomes. More than twenty-five million households in the United States\\nhave annual incomes in excess of $50,000; more than seven million have annual incomes over\\n$100,000. But in spite of being “good income” earners, too many of these people have small levels of\\naccumulated wealth. Many live from paycheck to paycheck. These are the people who will benefit\\nmost from this book.\\nThe median (typical) household in America has a net worth of less than $15,000, excluding home\\nequity. Factor out equity in motor vehicles, furniture, and such, and guess what? More often than not\\nthe household has zero financial assets, such as stocks and bonds. How long could the average\\nAmerican household survive economically without a monthly check from an employer? Perhaps a\\nmonth or two in most cases. Even those in the top quintile are not really wealthy. Their median\\nhousehold net worth is less than $150,000. Excluding home equity, the median net worth for this\\ngroup falls to less than $60,000. And what about our senior citizens? Without Social Security benefits,\\nalmost one-half of Americans over sixty-five would live in poverty.\\nOnly a minority of Americans have even the most conventional types of financial assets. Only about\\n15 percent of American households have a money market deposit account; 22 percent, a certificateof\\ndeposit; 4.2 percent, a money market fund; 3.4 percent, corporate or municipal bonds; fewer than 25\\npercent, stocks and mutual funds; 8.4 percent, rental property; 18.1 percent, U.S. Savings Bonds; and\\n23 percent, IRA or KEOGH accounts.\\nBut 65 percent of the households have equity in their own home, and more than 85 percent own one\\nor more motor vehicles. Cars tend to depreciate rapidly. Financial assets tend to appreciate.\\nThe millionaires we discuss in this book are financially independent. They could maintain their\\ncurrent lifestyle for years and years without earning even one month’s pay. The large majority of these\\nmillionaires are not the descendants of the Rockefellers or Vanderbilts. More than 80 percent are\\nordinary people who have accumulated their wealth in one generation. They did it slowly, steadily,\\nwithout signing a multimillion-dollar contract with the Yankees, without winning the lottery, without\\nbecoming the next Mick Jagger. Windfalls make great headlines, but such occurrences are rare. In the\\ncourse of an adult’s lifetime, the probability of becoming wealthy via such paths is lower than one in\\nfour thousand. Contrast these odds with the proportion of American households (3.5 per one hundred)\\nin the $1 million and over net worth category.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='THE SEVEN FACTORS\\nWho becomes wealthy? Usually the wealthy individual is a businessman who has lived in the same\\ntown for all of his adult life. This person owns a small factory, a chain of stores, or a service company.\\nHe has married once and remains married. He lives next door to people with a fraction of his wealth.\\nHe is a compulsive saver and investor. And he has made his money on his own. Eighty percent of\\nAmerica’s millionaires are first-generation rich.\\nAffluent people typically follow a lifestyle conducive to accumulating money. In the course of our\\ninvestigations, we discovered seven common denominators among those who successfully build\\nwealth.\\n1. They live well below their means.\\n2. They allocate their time, energy, and money efficiently, in ways conducive to building wealth.\\n3. They believe that financial independence is more important than displaying high social status.\\n4. Their parents did not provide economic outpatient care.\\n5. Their adult children are economically self-sufficient.\\n6. They are proficient in targeting market opportunities.\\n7. They chose the right occupation.\\nIn The Millionaire Next Door, you will study these seven characteristics of the wealthy. We hope\\nyou will learn how to develop them in yourself.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='THE RESEARCH\\nThe research for The Millionaire Next Door is the most comprehensive ever conducted on who the\\nwealthy are in America—and how they got that way. Much of this research was developed from the\\nmost recent survey we conducted that, in turn, was developed from studies we had conducted over the\\nprevious twenty years. These studies included personal and focus group interviews with more than\\nfive hundred millionaires and surveys of more than eleven thousand high-net worth and/or high-\\nincome respondents.\\nMore than one thousand people responded to our latest survey,* which was conducted from May\\n1995 through January 1996. It asked each respondent about his or her attitudes and behaviors\\nregarding a wide variety of wealth-related issues. Each participant in our study answered 249\\nquestions. These questions addressed topics ranging from household budget planning or lack of it to\\nfinancial fears and worries, and from methods of bargaining when purchasing automobiles to the\\ncategories of financial gifts, or “acts of kindness,” wealthy people give to their adult children. Several\\nsections of the questionnaire asked respondents to indicate the most they ever spent for motor\\nvehicles, wristwatches, suits, shoes, vacations, and the like. This study was the most ambitious and\\nthorough we have ever undertaken. No other study has focused on the key factors that explain how\\npeople become wealthy in one generation. Nor has a study revealed why many people, even most of\\nthose with high incomes, never accumulate even a modest amount of wealth.\\nIn addition to our survey, we gained considerable insight into the millionaire next door from other\\nresearch. We spent hundreds of hours conducting and analyzing in-depth interviews with self-made\\nmillionaires. We also interviewed many of their advisors, such as CPAs and other professional\\nexperts. These experts were very helpful in our exploration of the issues underlying the accumulation\\nof wealth.\\nWhat have we discovered in all of our research? Mainly, that building wealth takes discipline,\\nsacrifice, and hard work. Do you really want to become financially independent? Are you and your\\nfamily willing to reorient your lifestyle to achieve this goal? Many will likely conclude they are not.\\nIf you are willing to make the necessary trade-offs of your time, energy, and consumption habits,\\nhowever, you can begin building wealth and achieving financial independence. The Millionaire Next\\nDoor will start you on this journey.\\n* For details on how we targeted respondents for our survey, see Appendix 1.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='These people cannot be millionaires! They don’t look like millionaires, they don’t dress\\nlike millionaires, they don’t eat like millionaires, they don’t act like millionaires—they don’t\\neven have millionaire names. Where are the millionaires who look like millionaires?\\nT\\nhe person who said this was a vice president of a trust department. He made these comments\\nfollowing a focus group interview and dinner that we hosted for ten first-generation millionaires. His\\nview of millionaires is shared by most people who are not wealthy. They think millionaires own\\nexpensive clothes, watches, and other status artifacts. We have found this is not the case.\\nAs a matter of fact, our trust officer friend spends significantly more for his suits than the typical\\nAmerican millionaire. He also wears a $5,000 watch. We know from our surveys that the majority of\\nmillionaires never spent even one-tenth of $5,000 for a watch. Our friend also drives a current-model\\nimported luxury car. Most millionaires are not driving this year’s model. Only a minority drive a\\nforeign motor vehicle. An even smaller minority drive foreign luxury cars. Our trust officer leases,\\nwhile only a minority of millionaires ever lease their motor vehicles.\\nBut ask the typical American adult this question: Who looks more like a millionaire? Would it be\\nour friend, the trust officer, or one of the people who participated in our interview? We would wager\\nthat most people by a wide margin would pick the trust officer. But looks can be deceiving.\\nThis concept is perhaps best expressed by those wise and wealthy Texans who refer to our trust\\nofficer’s type as\\nBig Hat No Cattle\\nWe first heard this expression from a thirty-five-year-old Texan. He owned a very successful business\\nthat rebuilt large diesel engines. But he drove a ten-year-old car and wore jeans and a buckskin shirt.\\nHe lived in a modest house in a lower-middle-class area. His neighbors were postal clerks, firemen,\\nand mechanics.\\nAfter he substantiated his financial success with actual numbers, this Texan told us:\\n[My] business does not look pretty. I don’t play the part… don’t act it…. When my\\nBritish partners first met me, they thought I was one of our truck drivers…. They looked all\\nover my office, looked at everyone but me. Then the senior guy of the group said, “Oh, we\\nforgot we were in Texas!” I don’t own big hats, but I have a lot of cattle.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='PORTRAIT OF A MILLIONAIRE\\nWho is the prototypical American millionaire? What would he tell you about himself?*\\n♦ I am a fifty-seven-year-old male, married with three children. About 70 percent of us earn 80\\npercent or more of our household’s income.\\n♦ About one in five of us is retired. About two-thirds of us who are working are self-employed.\\nInterestingly, self-employed people make up less than 20 percent of the workers in America but\\naccount for two-thirds of the millionaires. Also, three out of four of us who are self-employed\\nconsider ourselves to be entrepreneurs. Most of the others are self-employed professionals, such as\\ndoctors and accountants.\\n♦ Many of the types of businesses we are in could be classified as dullnormal. We are welding\\ncontractors, auctioneers, rice farmers, owners of mobile-home parks, pest controllers, coin and stamp\\ndealers, and paving contractors.\\n♦ About half of our wives do not work outside the home. The number-one occupation for those wives\\nwho do work is teacher.\\n♦ Our household’s total annual realized (taxable) income is $131,000 (median, or 50th percentile),\\nwhile our average income is $247,000. Note that those of us who have incomes in the $500,000 to\\n$999,999 category (8 percent) and the $1 million or more category (5 percent) skew the average\\nupward.\\n♦ We have an average household net worth of $3.7 million. Of course, some of our cohorts have\\naccumulated much more. Nearly 6 percent have a net worth of over $10 million. Again, these people\\nskew our average upward. The typical (median, or 50th percentile) millionaire household has a net\\nworth of $1.6 million.\\n♦ On average, our total annual realized income is less than 7 percent of our wealth. In other words, we\\nlive on less than 7 percent of our wealth.\\n♦ Most of us (97 percent) are homeowners. We live in homes currently valued at an average of\\n$320,000. About half of us have occupied the same home for more than twenty years. Thus, we have\\nenjoyed significant increases in the value of our homes.\\n♦ Most of us have never felt at a disadvantage because we did not receive any inheritance. About 80\\npercent of us are first-generation affluent.\\n♦ We live well below our means. We wear inexpensive suits and drive American-made cars. Only a\\nminority of us drive the current-model-year automobile. Only a minority ever lease our motor\\nvehicles.\\n♦ Most of our wives are planners and meticulous budgeters. In fact, only 18 percent of us disagreed\\nwith the statement “Charity begins at home.” Most of us will tell you that our wives are a lot more\\nconservative with money than we are.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='♦ We have a “go-to-hell fund.” In other words, we have accumulated enough wealth to live without\\nworking for ten or more years. Thus, those of us with a net worth of $1.6 million could live\\ncomfortably for more than twelve years. Actually, we could live longer than that, since we save at\\nleast 15 percent of our earned income.\\n♦ We have more than six and one-half times the level of wealth of our nonmillionaire neighbors, but,\\nin our neighborhood, these nonmillionaires outnumber us better than three to one. Could it be that they\\nhave chosen to trade wealth for acquiring high-status material possessions?\\n♦ As a group, we are fairly well educated. Only about one in five are not college graduates. Many of us\\nhold advanced degrees. Eighteen percent have master’s degrees, 8 percent law degrees, 6 percent\\nmedical degrees, and 6 percent Ph.D.s.\\n♦ Only 17 percent of us or our spouses ever attended a private elementary or private high school. But\\n55 percent of our children are currently attending or have attended private schools.\\n♦ As a group, we believe that education is extremely important for ourselves, our children, and our\\ngrandchildren. We spend heavily for the educations of our offspring.\\n♦ About two-thirds of us work between forty-five and fifty-five hours per week.\\n♦ We are fastidious investors. On average, we invest nearly 20 percent of our household realized\\nincome each year. Most of us invest at least 15 percent. Seventy-nine percent of us have at least one\\naccount with a brokerage company. But we make our own investment decisions.\\n♦ We hold nearly 20 percent of our household’s wealth in transaction securities such as publicly\\ntraded stocks and mutual funds. But we rarely sell our equity investments. We hold even more in our\\npension plans. On average, 21 percent of our household’s wealth is in our private businesses.\\n♦ As a group, we feel that our daughters are financially handicapped in comparison to our sons. Men\\nseem to make much more money even within the same occupational categories. That is why most of\\nus would not hesitate to share some of our wealth with our daughters. Our sons, and men in general,\\nhave the deck of economic cards stacked in their favor. They should not need subsidies from their\\nparents.\\n♦ What would be the ideal occupations for our sons and daughters? There are about 3.5 millionaire\\nhouseholds like ours. Our numbers are growing much faster than the general population. Our kids\\nshould consider providing affluent people with some valuable service. Overall, our most trusted\\nfinancial advisors are our accountants. Our attorneys are also very important. So we recommend\\naccounting and law to our children. Tax advisors and estate-planning experts will be in big demand\\nover the next fifteen years.\\n♦ I am a tightwad. That’s one of the main reasons I completed a long questionnaire for a crispy $1 bill.\\nWhy else would I spend two or three hours being personally interviewed by these authors? They paid\\nme $100, $200, or $250. Oh, they made me another offer—to donate in my name the money I earned\\nfor my interview to my favorite charity. But I told them, “I am my favorite charity.”', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='“WEALTHY” DEFINED\\nAsk the average American to define the term wealthy. Most would give the same definition found in\\nWebster’s. Wealthy to them refers to people who have an abundance of material possessions.\\nWe define wealthy differently. We do not define wealthy, affluent, or rich in terms of material\\npossessions. Many people who display a high-consumption lifestyle have little or no investments,\\nappreciable assets, income-producing assets, common stocks, bonds, private businesses, oil/gas rights,\\nor timber land. Conversely, those people whom we define as being wealthy get much more pleasure\\nfrom owning substantial amounts of appreciable assets than from displaying a high-consumption\\nlifestyle.\\nTHE NOMINAL DEFINITION OF WEALTHY\\nOne way we determine whether someone is wealthy or not is based on net worth— “cattle,” not\\n“chattel.” Net worth is defined as the current value of one’s assets less liabilities (exclude the\\nprinciple in trust accounts). In this book we define the threshold level of being wealthy as having a net\\nworth of $1 million or more. Based on this definition, only 3.5 million (3.5 percent) of the 100 million\\nhouseholds in America are considered wealthy. About 95 percent of millionaires in America have a\\nnet worth of between $1 million and $10 million. Much of the discussion in this book centers on this\\nsegment of the population. Why the focus on this group? Because this level of wealth can be attained\\nin one generation. It can be attained by many Americans.\\nHOW WEALTHY SHOULD YOU BE?\\nAnother way of defining whether or not a person, household, or family is wealthy is based on one’s\\nexpected level of net worth. A person’s income and age are strong determinants of how much that\\nperson should be worth. In other words, the higher one’s income, the higher one’s net worth is\\nexpected to be (assuming one is working and not retired). Similarly, the longer one is generating\\nincome, the more likely one will accumulate more and more wealth. So higher-income people who are\\nolder should have accumulated more wealth than lower-income producers who are younger.\\nFor most people in America with annual realized incomes of $50,000 or more and for most people\\ntwenty-five to sixty-five years of age, there is a corresponding expected level of wealth. Those who\\nare significantly above this level can be considered wealthy in relation to others in their income/age\\ncohort.\\nYou may ask: How can someone be considered wealthy if, for example, he is worth only $460,000?\\nAfter all, he’s not a millionaire. Charles Bobbins is a forty-one-year-old fireman. His wife is a\\nsecretary. They have a combined annual income of $55,000. According to our research findings, Mr.\\nBobbins should have a net worth of approximately $225,500. But he is worth much more than others\\nin his income/age category. Mr. and Mrs. Bobbins have been able to accumulate an above-average\\namount of net worth. Thus, they apparently know how to live on a fireman’s and secretary’s income\\nand still save and invest a good bit. They likely have a low-consumption lifestyle. And given this\\nlifestyle, Mr. Bobbins could sustain himself and his family for ten years without working. Within their', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='income and age categories, the Bobbinses are wealthy.\\nThe Bobbinses are quite different from John J. Ashton, M.D., age fifty-six, who has an annual\\nincome of approximately $560,000. How much is Dr. Ashton worth? Is he wealthy? According to one\\ndefinition, he is, since his net worth is $1.1 million. But he is not wealthy according to our other\\ndefinition. Given his age and income, he should be worth more than $3 million.\\nWith his high-consumption lifestyle, how long do you think Dr. Ashton could sustain himself and\\nhis family if he were no longer employed? Perhaps for two, at most three, years.\\nHOW TO DETERMINE IF YOU’RE WEALTHY\\nWhatever your age, whatever your income, how much should you be worth right now? From years of\\nsurveying various high-income/ high-net worth people, we have developed several multivariate-based\\nwealth equations. A simple rule of thumb, however, is more than adequate in computing one’s\\nexpected net worth.\\nMultiply your age times your realized pretax annual household income from all sources\\nexcept inheritances. Divide by ten. This, less any inherited wealth, is what your net worth\\nshould be.\\nFor example, if Mr. Anthony O. Duncan is forty-one years old, makes $143,000 a year, and has\\ninvestments that return another $12,000, he would multiply $155,000 by forty-one. That equals\\n$6,355,000. Dividing by ten, his net worth should be $635,500. If Ms. Lucy R. Frankel is sixty-one and\\nhas a total annual realized income of $235,000, her net worth should be $1,433,500.\\nGiven your age and income, how does your net worth match up? Where do you stand along the\\nwealth continuum? If you are in the top quartile for wealth accumulation, you are a PAW, or\\nprodigious accumulator of wealth. If you are in the bottom quartile, you are a UAW, or under\\naccumulator of wealth. Are you a PAW, a UAW, or just an AAW (average accumulator of wealth)?\\nWe have developed another simple rule. To be well positioned in the PAW category, you should be\\nworth twice the level of wealth expected. In other words, Mr. Duncan’s net worth/wealth should be\\napproximately twice the expected value or more for his income/age cohort, or $635,500 multiplied by\\ntwo equals $1,271,000. If Mr. Duncan’s net worth is approximately $1.27 million or more, he is a\\nprodigious accumulator of wealth. Conversely, what if his level of wealth is one-half or less than\\nexpected for all those in his income/age category? Mr. Duncan would be classified as a UAW if his\\nlevel of wealth were $317,750 or less (or one-half of $635,500).\\nPAWs VERSUS UAWs\\nPAWs are builders of wealth—that is, they are the best at building net worth compared to others in\\ntheir income/age category. PAWs typically have a minimum of four times the wealth accumulated by\\nUAWs. Contrasting the characteristics of PAWs and UAWs is one of the most revealing parts of the\\nresearch we have conducted over the past twenty years.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='A good example of the difference between PAWs and UAWs is revealed in two case studies. Mr.\\nMiller “Bubba” Richards, age fifty, is the proprietor of a mobile-home dealership. His total household\\nincome last year was $90,200. Mr. Richards’s net worth, as computed via the wealth equation, is\\nexpected to be $451,000. But “Bubba” is a PAW. His actual net worth is $1.1 million.\\nHis counterpart is James H. Ford II. Mr. Ford, age fifty-one, is an attorney. His income last year\\nwas $92,330, slightly more than Mr. Richards’s. What is Mr. Ford’s actual net worth? His expected\\nlevel of wealth? Mr. Ford’s actual net worth is $226,511, while his expected level of wealth (again\\ncomputed from the wealth equation) is $470,883. Mr. Ford, by our definition, is an under accumulator\\nof wealth. Mr. Ford spent seven years in college. How can he possiblyhave less wealth than a mobile-\\nhome dealer? In fact, Mr. Richards has nearly five times the net worth of Mr. Ford. And remember,\\nboth are in the same income/age cohort. In trying to answer the above question, ask yourself two\\nsimpler questions:\\n♦ How much money does it take to maintain the upper-middle-class lifestyle of an attorney and his\\nfamily?\\n♦ How much money is required to maintain the middle-class or even blue-collar lifestyle of a mobile-\\nhome dealer and his family?\\nClearly, Mr. Ford, the attorney, must spend significantly more of his household’s income to\\nmaintain and display his family’s higher upper-middle-class lifestyle. What make of motor vehicle is\\ncongruent with the status of an attorney? Foreign luxury, no doubt. Who needs to wear a different\\nhigh-quality suit to work each day? Who needs to join one or more country clubs? Who needs\\nexpensive Tiffany silverware and serving trays?\\nMr. Ford, the UAW, has a higher propensity to spend than do the members of the PAW group.\\nUAWs tend to live above their means; they emphasize consumption. And they tend to de-emphasize\\nmany of the key factors that underlie wealth building.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='YOU OR YOUR ANCESTORS?\\nMost of America’s millionaires are first-generation rich. How is it possible for people from modest\\nbackgrounds to become millionaires in one generation? Why is it that so many people with similar\\nsocioeconomic backgrounds never accumulate even modest amounts of wealth?\\nMost people who become millionaires have confidence in their own abilities. They do not spend\\ntime worrying about whether or not their parents were wealthy. They do not believe that one must be\\nborn wealthy. Conversely, people of modest backgrounds who believe that only the wealthy produce\\nmillionaires are predetermined to remain non-affluent. Have you always thought that most\\nmillionaires are bornwith silver spoons in their mouths? If so, consider the following facts that our\\nresearch uncovered about American millionaires:\\n♦ Only 19 percent receive any income or wealth of any kind from a trust fund or an estate.\\n♦ Fewer than 20 percent inherited 10 percent or more of their wealth.\\n♦ More than half never received as much as $1 in inheritance.\\n♦ Fewer than 25 percent ever received “an act of kindness” of $10,000 or more from their parents,\\ngrandparents, or other relatives.\\n♦ Ninety-one percent never received, as a gift, as much as $1 of the ownership of a family business.\\n♦ Nearly half never received any college tuition from their parents or other relatives.\\n♦ Fewer than 10 percent believe they will ever receive an inheritance in the future.\\nAmerica continues to hold great prospects for those who wish to accumulate wealth in one\\ngeneration. In fact, America has always been a land of opportunity for those who believe in the fluid\\nnature of our nation’s social system and economy.\\nMore than one hundred years ago the same was true. In The American Economy, Stanley Lebergott\\nreviews a study conducted in 1892 of the 4,047 American millionaires. He reports that 84 percent\\n“were nouveau riche, having reached the top without the benefit of inherited wealth.”\\nBRITANNIA RULES?\\nJust before the American Revolution, most of this nation’s wealth was held by landowners. More than\\nhalf the land was owned by people who either were born in England or were born in America of\\nEnglish parents. Is more than half of this nation’s wealth now of English origin? No. One of the major\\nmyths concerning wealth in this country relates to ethnic origin. Too many people think that\\nAmerica’s affluent population is composed predominantly of direct descendants of the Mayflower\\nvoyagers.\\nTHE TOP TEN ANCESTRY GROUPS OF AMERICAN MILLIONAIRES\\nLet’s examine this assumption objectively. What if “country of origin” were the major factor in\\nexplaining variation in wealth? We would expect that more than half of America’s millionaire', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='population would be of English ancestry. This is not the case (see Table 1-1). In our most recent\\nnational survey of millionaires, we asked the respondents to designate their country of\\norigin/ancestry/ethnic origin. The results may surprise you.\\nTABLE 1-1\\nTHE TOP TEN ANCESTRY GROUPS OF AMERICAN MILLIONAIRES\\nThose designating “English” as their ethnic origin accounted for 21.1 percent of the millionaire\\npopulation. People of English origin account for 10.3 percent of the United States household\\npopulation in general. Thus, American millionaires of English origin are more prevalent than\\nexpected, given their numbers in the entire U.S. population (10.3 percent versus 21.1 percent). In other\\nwords, this group has a millionaire concentration ratio of 2.06 (21.1 percent of all millionaire\\nhouseholds divided by 10.3 percent of all households headed by persons of English origin), meaning\\nthat people of English origin are about twice as likely to head households in the millionaire category\\nthan would be expected from their portion of all households in America.\\nAnd yet, what percentage of the English ancestry group in America is in the millionaire category?\\nWould you expect the English group to rank first? In fact, it ranks fourth. According to our research,\\n7.71 percent of all households in the English category have a net worth of $1 million or more. Three\\nother ancestry groups have significantly higher concentrations of millionaires.\\nHow can it be possible that the English ancestry group does not have the highest concentration of\\nmillionaire households? After all, they were among the first Europeans to arrive in the New World.\\nThey were on the ground floor to take economic advantage in this land of opportunity. In 1790\\nColonial America, more than two-thirds of households were headed by a self-employed person. In\\nAmerica, the achievements of the current generation are more a factor in explaining wealth\\naccumulation than what has taken place in the past. Again, most American millionaires today (about\\n80 percent) are first-generation rich. Typically, the fortunes built by these people will be completely', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='dissipated by the second or third generation. The American economy is a fluid one. There are many\\npeople today who are on their way to becoming wealthy. And there are many others who are spending\\ntheir way out of the affluent category.\\nWINNING ANCESTRY GROUPS\\nIf the English ancestry group does not have the highest concentration of millionaire households, then\\nwhich group does? The Russian ancestry group ranks first, the Scottish ranks second, and the\\nHungarian ranks third. Although the Russian ancestry group accounts for onlyabout 1.1 percent of all\\nhouseholds in America, it accounts for 6.4 percent of all millionaire households. We estimate that\\napproximately 22 of every 100 households headed by someone of Russian ancestry has a net worth of\\n$1 million or more. This is in sharp contrast to the English ancestry group, in which only 7.71 in 100\\nof its members are in the millionaire league. How much wealth does this Russian American\\nmillionaire group have in total? We estimate approximately $1.1 trillion, or nearly 5 percent of all the\\npersonal wealth in America today!\\nHow can one explain the economic productivity of Russian Americans? In general, most American\\nmillionaires are manager-owners of businesses. Russians in disproportionate numbers are manager-\\nowners of businesses. Further, this entrepreneurial spirit seems to translate from one generation of\\nRussians to the next.\\nThe Hungarian ancestry group also is entrepreneurially inclined. This group accounts for only 0.5\\npercent of all households in this country. Yet it makes up 2 percent of the millionaire households.\\nContrast this with the German ancestry group, which accounts for nearly one in five households (19.5\\npercent) in this country. Only 17.3 percent of all millionaire households are headed by persons of\\nGerman ancestry, and only about 3.3 percent of German households are in the millionaire league.\\nTHRIFTY SCOTS\\nThe Scottish ancestry group makes up only 1.7 percent of all households. But it accounts for 9.3\\npercent of the millionaire households in America. Thus, in terms of concentration, the Scottish\\nancestry group is more than five times (5.47) more likely to contain millionaire households than\\nwould be expected from its overall portion (1.7 percent) of American households.\\nThe Scottish ancestry group ranks second in terms of the percentage of its clan that are in the\\nmillionaire league. Nearly twenty-one (20.8) in 100 of its households are millionaires. What explains\\nthe Scottish ancestry group’s high ranking? It is true that many Scots were early immigrants to\\nAmerica. But this is not the major reason for their economic productivity. Remember that the English\\nwere among the earliest immigrants, yet their concentration numbers are far lower thanthose of the\\nScots. Also consider that the Scots did not enjoy the same solid economic status that the English\\nenjoyed during the years the nation was in its infancy. Given these facts, one would think that the\\nEnglish ancestry group would account for a higher concentration of millionaire households than those\\nin the Scottish group. But just the opposite is the case. Again, the Scottish ancestry group has a\\nconcentration level nearly three times that of the English group (5.47 versus 2.06). What then makes\\nthe Scottish ancestry group unique?\\nIf an ancestry group has a high concentration of millionaires, what would we expect the income', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='characteristics of that group to be? The expectation is that the group would have an equally high\\nconcentration of high-income producers. Income is highly correlated with net worth; more than two-\\nthirds of the millionaires in America have annual household incomes of $100,000 or more. In fact, this\\ncorrelation exists for all major ancestry groups but one: the Scottish. This group has a much higher\\nnumber of high-net worth households than can be explained by the presence of high-income-producing\\nhouseholds alone. High-income-producing Scottish-ancestry households account for less than 2\\npercent of all high-income households in America. But remember that the Scottish ancestry group\\naccounts for 9.3 percent of the millionaire households in America today. More than 60 percent of\\nScottish-ancestry millionaires have annual household incomes of less than $100,000. No other\\nancestry group has such a high concentration of millionaires from such a small concentration of high-\\nincome-producing households.\\nIf income does not come near in explaining the affluence of the Scottish ancestry group in America,\\nwhat factors do shed light on this phenomenon? There are several fundamental factors.\\nFirst, Scottish Americans tend to be frugal. Given a household’s income, there is a corresponding\\nmathematical expectation of level of consumption. Members of this group do not fit such\\nexpectations. On average, they live well below the norm for people in various income categories. They\\noften live in self-designed environments of relative scarcity. A household of Scottish ancestry with an\\nannual income of $100,000 will often consume at a level typical for an American household with an\\nannual income of $85,000. Being frugal allows them to save more and invest more than others in\\nsimilar income groups. Thus the same $100,000 income-producing household of Scottish descentsaves\\nand invests at a level comparable to the typical American household that annually earns nearly\\n$150,000.\\nIn the chapters that follow, we reveal the highest prices typical millionaires reported paying for\\nsuits, shoes, watches, and motor vehicles. A significantly greater number of millionaires with Scottish\\nancestry reported paying less for each item than the norm for all millionaires in the sample. For\\nexample, more than two-thirds (67.3 percent) of Scottish millionaires paid less for their most\\nexpensive motor vehicle than the norm for all millionaires surveyed.\\nBecause they accumulate wealth, the Scottish-ancestry affluent have wealth to pass on to their\\noffspring. Our research reveals that Scottish offspring typically become economically and emotionally\\nindependent even as young adults. Thus, they tend not to drain their parents’ wealth.\\nMembers of the Scottish-ancestry group have been able to instill their values of thrift, discipline,\\neconomic achievement, and financial independence in successive generations. These values are also\\ntypical traits among most self-made millionaires.\\nSMALL POPULATIONS\\nOften small-population groups are underrepresented in studies of the affluent. Yet many contain high\\nconcentrations of wealthy households. What small groups in particular? We estimate that all of the\\nfifteen small-population ancestry groups shown in Table 1-2 have at least twice the proportion of\\nmillionaires than the proportion for all U.S. households. Only about 3.5 percent of all U.S. households\\nare in the million-dollar net worth league. All the groups listed in Table 1-2 are estimated to contain at\\nleast twice this proportion. (In total, all fifteen account for less than 1 percent of all affluent\\nhouseholds.) In fact, there is compelling evidence of an inverse relationship between the size of an\\nancestry group and the proportion of its members that are wealthy. In other words, larger ancestry\\ngroups contain smaller proportions of millionaires on average than smaller groups.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='What about the number of years that an average member of an ancestry group has been in America?\\nThe longer the time here, the less likely it will produce a disproportionately large percentage of\\nmillionaires. Why is this the case? Because we are a consumption-based society. In general, the\\nlonger the average member of an ancestry group has been in America, the more likely he or she will\\nbecome fully socialized to our high-consumption lifestyle. There is another reason. First-generation\\nAmericans tend to be self-employed. Self-employment is a major positive correlate of wealth.\\nTABLE 1-2\\nTHE TOP FIFTEEN ECONOMICALLY PRODUCTIVE SMALL POPULATION ANCESTRY\\nGROUPS\\nThis is not to suggest that self-employment and/or being first-generation American ensures\\nmembership among the ranks of millionaires. Most self-employed Americans will never accumulate\\neven modest levels of wealth. The same is true for most first-generation Americans. But twenty-three\\nmillion people in this country today were born elsewhere. That is a large gene pool. Note also that 12\\npercent of INC. magazine’s top five hundred business entrepreneurs are first-generation American.\\nOne might expect that the sons, daughters, grandsons, and granddaughters of these people would', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='automatically become even more successful economically than they. Not really. We will discuss\\nintergenerational transfers in more detail in Chapters 5 and 6, but allow us at this juncture to explain\\nwhy the “next generation” is often less productive economically than the last.\\nVICTOR AND HIS CHILDREN\\nTake the case of Victor, a successful entrepreneur who is first-generation American. Entrepreneurs\\nlike him have typically been characterized by their thrift, low status, discipline, low consumption,\\nrisk, and very hard work. But after these genetic wonders become financial successes, then what?\\nWhat do they teach their children? Do they encourage them to follow Dad’s lead? Do their children\\nalso become roofing contractors, excavation contractors, scrap metal dealers, and so on? The chances\\nare they don’t. Fewer than one in five do.\\nNo, Victor wants his children to have a better life. He encourages them to spend many years in\\ncollege. Victor wants his children to become physicians, lawyers, accountants, executives, and so on.\\nBut in so encouraging them, Victor essentially discourages his children from becoming entrepreneurs.\\nHe unknowingly encourages them to postpone their entry into the labor market. And, of course, he\\nencourages them to reject his lifestyle of thrift and a self-imposed environment of scarcity.\\nVictor wants his children to have a better life. But what exactly does Victor mean when he says\\nthat? He means that his children should be well educated and have a much higher occupational status\\nthan he did. Also, “better” means better artifacts: fine homes, new luxury automobiles, quality\\nclothing, club membership. But Victor has neglected to include in this definition of better many of the\\nelements that were the foundation stones of his success. He does not realize that being well educated\\nhas certain economic drawbacks.\\nVictor’s well-educated adult children have learned that a high level of consumption is expected of\\npeople who spend many years in college and professional schools. Today his children are under\\naccumulators of wealth. They are the opposite of their father, the blue-collar, successful business\\nowner. His children have become Americanized. They are part of the high-consuming, employment-\\npostponing generation.\\nHow many generations does it take for an ancestry group that today contains thousands of Victors to\\nbecome Americanized? Only a few. Most move into the “American normal” range within one or two\\ngenerations. This is why America needs a constant flow of immigrants with the courage and tenacity\\nof Victor. These immigrants and their immediate offspring are constantly needed to replace the\\nVictors of America.\\nTHE AUTHORS AND TODDY AND ALEX\\nSeveral years ago we were asked to conduct a study of the affluent in America. We were hired by\\nToddy, a corporate vice president of a subsidiary of a large corporation. Toddy’s ancestors were\\nEnglish. His forefathers were in America before the Revolutionary War. More recently, they owned\\nsteel mills in Pennsylvania. Toddy, their direct descendant, attended an exclusive prep school in New\\nEngland. Later he graduated from Princeton University. While in college, he played varsity football.\\nToddy, like many people in this country, had always believed that wealthy people inherited their\\nfortunes. Toddy also believed that most wealthy people had English roots. So what happened to', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Toddy’s long-held opinions after he joined us out in the survey field, meeting America’s millionaires?\\nMost of the millionaire respondents Toddy met were first-generation affluent. And most were not of\\nEnglish origin. Most of them attended public schools; they drove American-made automobiles; they\\npreferred club sandwiches to caviar. And, unlike Toddy, most were frugal.\\nToddy’s education was enhanced by another event. During the course of our assignment, an\\nentrepreneur named Alex approached Toddy and the other senior officers of the corporation. Alex\\nwanted to buy the firm that employed Toddy. Who was this Alex fellow, anyway? His father had\\nimmigrated to this country from Russia before Alex was born. His dad was a small business owner.\\nAlex had graduated from a state university. “How could it be possible,” Toddy asked, “that this fellow\\nwants to, and has the resources to, buy the company?” Alex’s dad answered the question quite\\nsuccinctly:\\nRussians—they are the best horse traders.\\nAlex is a self-made multimillionaire. His is the prototypical American success story. Conversely,\\nToddy and others like him are an endangered species. Someday, they may even be extinct. This is\\nespecially true for those who spend a lot of time reminiscing about how their late ancestors founded\\nsteel mills, railroads, and pony express services long, long ago.\\n* Our profile of the typical millionaire is based on studies of millionaire households, not\\nindividuals. It is, therefore, impossible in most cases to say with certainty whether our typical\\nmillionaire is a he or a she. Nevertheless, because 95 percent of millionaire households are\\ncomposed of married couples, and because in 70 percent of these cases the male head of the\\nhousehold contributes at least 80 percent of the income, we will usually refer to the typical\\nAmerican millionaire as “he” in this book.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='THEY LIVE WELL BELOW THEIR MEANS.\\nT\\nhe first time we interviewed a group of people worth at least $10 million (decamillionaires), the\\nsession turned out differently than we had planned.

Our client wanted us to study the needs of high-net worth individuals.\\nTo make sure our decamillionaire respondents felt comfortable during the interview, we rented a\\nposh penthouse on Manhattan’s fashionable East Side. We also hired two gourmet food designers.\\nThey put together a menu of four pâtés and three kinds of caviar. To accompany this, the designers\\nsuggested a case of high-quality 1970 Bordeaux plus a case of a “wonderful” 1973 cabernet sauvignon.\\nArmed with what we thought would be the ideal menu, we enthusiastically awaited the arrival of\\nour decamillionaire respondents.

His dress was what you might call\\ndull-normal—a well-worn suit and overcoat.\\nNevertheless, we wanted to make Mr. Bud feel that we fully understood the food and drink\\nexpectations of America’s decamillionaires. So after we introduced ourselves, one of us asked, “Mr.\\nBud, may I pour you a glass of 1970 Bordeaux?”\\nMr. Bud looked at us with a puzzled expression on his face and then said:\\nI drink scotch and two kinds of beer—free and BUD WEISER!\\nWe hid our shock as the true meaning of our decamillionaire’s message dawned upon us. During the\\nsubsequent two-hour interview, the nine decamillionaire respondents shifted constantly in their chairs.\\nOccasionally they glanced at the buffet. But not one touched the pâté or drank our vintage wines. We\\nknew they were hungry, but all they ate were the gourmet crackers. We hate to waste food. How did\\nwe dispose of our food and drink? No, we did not have to throw it away. The trust officers in the next\\nroom consumed most of it. Of course, the authors helped! It seems that most of us were gourmets.\\nHowever, none of us was a decamillionaire.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='A FOUNDATION FOR BUILDING WEALTH\\nToday we are much wiser about the lifestyles of the affluent. When we interview millionaires these\\ndays, we offer a spread that is more congruent with their way of life.

We define wasteful as a lifestyle marked by lavish spending and\\nhyperconsumption.\\nBeing frugal is the cornerstone of wealth-building. Yet far too often the big spenders are promoted\\nand sensationalized by the popular press. We are constantly barraged with media hype about so-called\\nmillionaire athletes, for example. Yes, some of the members of this small population are millionaires.\\nBut if a highly skilled ball player makes $5 million a year, having $1 million in net worth is no big\\ndeal. According to our wealth equation, a $5 million earner who is thirty years of age should be worth\\n$15 million or more. How many highly paid ball players have a level of wealth in this range? We\\nbelieve only a tiny fraction. Why? Because most have a lavish lifestyle—and they can support such a\\nlifestyle as long as they are earning a very high income. Technically, they may be millionaires (have a\\nminimum net worth of $1 million or more), but they are typically low on the prodigious accumulator\\nof wealth (PAW) scale.\\nHow many households in America earn $5 million in one year? Fewer than five thousand of the\\nnearly 100 million households. That’s about one in twenty thousand. Most millionaires never earn\\none-tenth of $5 million in a year. Most never become millionaires until they are fifty years of age or\\nolder. Most are frugal. And few could have ever supported a high-consumption lifestyle and become\\nmillionaires in the same lifetime.\\nBut the lavish lifestyle sells TV time and newspapers. All too often young people are indoctrinated\\nwith the belief that “those who have money spend lavishly” and “if you don’t show it, you don’t have\\nit.” Could you imagine the media hyping the frugal lifestyle of the typical American millionaire?\\nWhat would the results be? Low TV ratings and lack of readership, because most people who build\\nwealth in America are hard working, thrifty, and not at all glamorous. Wealth is rarely gained through\\nthe lottery, with a home run, or in quiz show fashion.

First, viewers will likely be confused, because Johnny does not look like the millionaire\\nmost people envision. Second, they may be uncomfortable. Johnny’s traditional family values and his\\nlifestyle of hard work, discipline, sacrifice, thrift, and sound investment habits might threaten the\\naudience. What happens when you tell the average American adult that he needs to reduce his\\nspending in order to build wealth for the future? He may perceive this as a threat to his way of life.

The\\naudience’s expectations are not congruent with the reality of most American millionaires.\\nAccording to our most recent survey, the typical American millionaire reported that he (she) never\\nspent more than $399 for a suit of clothing for himself or for anyone else. Note the figures given in\\nTable 2-1. Fifty percent or more of the millionaires surveyed paid $399 or less for the most expensive\\nsuit they ever purchased. Only about one in ten paid $1,000 or more; only about one in one hundred\\npaid $2,800 or more. Conversely, about one in four millionaires paid $285 or less, and one in ten paid\\n$195 or less for his (her) most expensive suit.\\nTABLE 2-1\\nPRICES PAID BY MILLIONAIRES FOR CLOTHING AND ACCESSORIES\\nThese figures are for all millionaires in our survey. Keep in mind that almost 14 percent of those\\nsurveyed told us they inherited their wealth. What happens when we break out inheritors and self-\\nmade millionaires? Self-made millionaires spend significantly less for suits, as well as for most other\\nhigh-status items, than do those who have inherited their wealth. The typical (50th percentile) self-\\nmade millionaire paid about $360 for a suit, while the typical inheritor of wealth reported paying more\\nthan $600.\\nHow can the Johnnys of America get away with spending such modest amounts? Johnny does not\\nneed to wear expensive suits. He is not a successful attorney who must impress his clients. Nor does\\nhe ever have to impress a large audience of stockholders at an annual meeting, the financial press, or\\ninvestment bankers. Johnny does not have to dress the part of a high-powered CEO who must\\nconstantly address a high-brow board of directors. Johnny does, however, need to impress his staff of\\njanitors. How? By never giving them the impression that he is making so much money he can afford to\\nhave a tailor fit him for a suit priced in the low-to mid-four figures.\\nMost of the millionaires we have interviewed over the past twenty years have views similar to', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Johnny’s. Then who purchases all those expensive suits? Our survey has revealed an interesting\\nrelationship. For every millionaire who owns a $1,000 suit, there are at least six owners who have\\nannual incomes in the $50,000 to $200,000 range but who are not millionaires. Their shopping habits\\ncertainly have something to do with the fact that they are not wealthy. Who are these people?\\nTypically, they do not own their own businesses. They are more likely to be corporate middle\\nmanagers (especially those who are part of a working couple), attorneys, sales and marketing\\nprofessionals, and physicians.\\nWhy would anyone suggest that you spend more than the typical millionaire for a suit? In a recently\\npublished article, an owner of very expensive suits touted that they were an excellent investment\\n(Lawrence Minard, “You’re Looking Rather Prosperous, Sir,” Forbes, April 8, 1996, pp. 132–133).\\nMr. Minard asks and answers the question of questions about investing in suits:\\nCan custom-made suits be worth $2,000? Mine are. Fourteen years and 14 pounds later,\\nthey still look good…. Believe it or not I made an excellent investment (Minard, p. 132).\\nMr. Minard tells his readers how he was initially guided to the custom tailor shops of London’s\\nSavile Row by two senior-level executives whom he regarded as having “excellent taste” but were not\\n“frivolous” in their buying habits:\\nThey explained that to buy bespoke is to enter into a unique and personal relationship\\nwith your clothes (Minard, p. 132).\\nWhat is the meaning of bespoke? In middle-class American, it means custom-made. Johnny Lucas\\nnever bought a custom-made suit. Does he have a “unique and personal relationship” with his all-\\nwool, top-of-the-line JC Penney suit? (Are you surprised to learn that some millionaires shop at\\nPenney’s? Perhaps even more surprising, about 30.4 percent of the respondents who are millionaires\\nhold JC Penney credit cards.) Penney’s private-brand Stafford Executive suits were recently given top\\nscores for durability, cut, and fit by a leading consumer publication:\\nJC Penney … now subject[s] garments to tough tests for color matching, fabric\\nshrinkage, and pilling…. When it comes to quality control Penney’s is more demanding than\\nany of the department stores (Teri Agins, “Why Cheap Clothes Are Getting More Respect,”\\nThe Wall Street Journal, Oct. 16, 1995, pp. B1, B3).\\nKeep in mind that moths, cigar ashes, and other hazards do not care how much you paid for your\\nwool suit. They do not understand the full meaning of bespoke. They are not interested in the fact that\\na suit with the same label was also worn by Dickens, de Gaulle, and Churchill. Nor do they care if\\nyour suits ever generate dividends or capital gains. But they can certainly ruin your investment\\nportfolio of suits.\\nTHEN CERTAINLY FOOTWEAR', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Let us return to our proposed TV program. Mr. Lucas is still on stage. What type of shoes does Johnny\\nLucas purchase? The TV audience, if any are still tuned in, will again be surprised by his answer.\\nJohnny, like most millionaires, does not buy high-priced footwear. About half the millionaires\\nsurveyed reported that they had never spent $140 or more for a pair of shoes. One in four had never\\nspent more than $100. Only about one in ten had spent over $300. If not millionaires, then who is\\nkeeping the high-priced shoe manufacturers and dealers in business? Certainly some millionaires\\npurchase expensive shoes. But for every millionaire in the “highest price paid” category of over $300,\\nthere are at least eight nonmillionaires.\\nBut what does the popular press tell us? The press sensationalizes that very small proportion of\\nAmericans who purchase expensive shoes and related artifacts. Consider this news story about boxing\\npromoter Don King, who spent two hours shopping for shoes in Atlanta. During that time, Mr. King\\npurchased 110 pairs of shoes from one store, for which he paid $64,100, tax included. His purchase\\ntopped the previous sales record for the store, held by Magic Johnson, who spent $35,000 during one\\nvisit. Mr. King’s record purchase translates into an average of $582.73 per pair. How much did Mr.\\nKing pay for his most expensive pair? It was reported thata pair of alligator loafers cost him $850\\n(Jeff Schultz, “King Foots $64,100 Bill at Shoe Store,” Atlanta Journal-Constitution, June 4, 1995, p.\\n1).\\nNote that only 1 percent of the millionaires in our survey paid $667 or more for a pair of shoes. Mr.\\nKing’s purchase of alligator shoes is rare even among millionaires. Nonetheless, the popular media\\nenjoy touting abnormalities in buying behavior. As a consequence, our youth are told that buying\\nexpensive items is normal behavior for affluent people. They are led to believe that the wealthy have a\\nhigh-consumption lifestyle. They learn that hyperspending is the main reward for becoming affluent\\nin America.\\nWhy does Johnny Lucas get ignored while Mr. King receives headlines? Because Johnny’s\\nconsumption habits are mundane. His rewards are more intangible than product-related: financial\\nindependence; discipline; and being an excellent family provider, a fine husband, and a father of well-\\ndisciplined children.\\nTHE LAST CHANCE FOR MR. LUCAS\\nIs there any life remaining for our proposed TV program about America’s typical millionaire? Can\\nJohnny Lucas still rally and bring back the audience he lost?\\nJohnny Lucas, the affluent business owner, is very punctual. He is never late for meetings and\\narrives at work each weekday at 6:30 A.M. How does he do this? It must be his wristwatch. Could it\\nbe that Johnny wears an expensive watch? By now you have probably guessed the answer. And once\\nagain, the audience is disappointed. Fully one-half of the millionaires surveyed never in their lives\\nspent more than $235 for a wristwatch. About one in ten never paid more than $47, while about one in\\nfour spent $100 or less.\\nCertainly some millionaires purchase expensive watches. But they are in the minority. Even among\\nmillionaires, only 25 percent of those surveyed paid $1,125 or more. About one in ten paid $3,800 or\\nmore. About one in one hundred paid $15,000 or more.\\nJohnny would, we are sure, apologize to the TV audience for his mundane taste in clothing and\\njewelry.

All my children’s college accounts were\\nmore than fully funded before they even began attending college.\\nUnfortunately, Johnny’s story, including his apology, will never get into syndication.\\nSO RARE THE JOHNNY LUCASES\\nWhy are so few people in America affluent? Even most households with six-figure annual incomes are\\nnot affluent. These people have a different orientation than does Johnny Lucas. They believe in\\nspending tomorrow’s cash today. They are debt-prone and are on earn-and-consume treadmills. To\\nmany of them, those who do not display abundant material possessions are not successful. To them,\\nnondisplay-oriented people like Johnny Lucas are their inferiors.\\nJohnny Lucas is not likely to be held in high regard by many of his neighbors. On a social status\\nscale, he is below average. But on what criteria? In his neighbors’ eyes, Johnny has low occupational\\nstatus. He is an owner of a small business. What happens when he occasionally comes home in one of\\nhis janitorial vans? The van stays in his driveway until he leaves the next morning. What are his\\nneighbors to think? They do not know that Johnny is financially independent. They don’t give him\\npoints for being married and never divorced, fully funding his children’s college tuition, employing\\nseveral dozen people, having integrity, being frugal, paying off his mortgage, and so forth. No, many\\nof his neighbors would prefer that Johnny move out of the neighborhood. Why? Perhaps it’s because\\nhe and his family don’t look affluent, dress like the affluent, drive the vehicles of the affluent, or work\\nin high-status positions.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='PLAYING GREAT DEFENSE\\nThe affluent tend to answer “yes” to three questions we include in our surveys:\\n1. Were your parents very frugal?\\n2. Are you frugal?\\n3. Is your spouse more frugal than you are?\\nThis last question is highly significant. Not only are the most prodigious accumulators of wealth\\nfrugal, their spouses tend to be even more frugal. Consider the typical affluent household. Nearly 95\\npercent of millionaire households are composed of married couples. In 70 percent of these households,\\nthe male contributes at least 80 percent of the income. Most of these men play great offense in the\\ngame called income generation. Great offense in economic terms means that a household generates an\\nincome significantly higher than the norm, which in America is an annual realized income of\\napproximately $33,000. Most of these households also play great defense; that is, they are frugal when\\nit comes to spending for consumer goods and services. One frugal high-income producer within the\\nmarried-couple category, however, does not automatically translate into a high level of net worth.\\nSomething else must be present. A self-made millionaire stated it best when he told us:\\nI can’t get my wife to spend any money!\\nMost people will never become wealthy in one generation if they are married to people who are\\nwasteful. A couple cannot accumulate wealth if one of its members is a hyperconsumer. This is\\nespecially true when one or both are trying to build a successful business. Few people can sustain\\nprofligate spending habits and simultaneously build wealth.\\nODE TO HIS FRUGAL WIFE\\nHow did the wife of a millionaire respond when her husband gave her $8 million worth of stock in the\\ncompany he recently took public? According to her husband of thirty-one years, she said, “I appreciate\\nthis, I really do.” Then she smiled, never changing her position at the kitchen table, where she\\ncontinued to cut out twenty-five-and fifty-cents-off food coupons from the week’s supply of\\nnewspapers. Nothing is so important as to interrupt her Saturday-morning chores. “She just does today\\nlike she always has done, even when all we owned was a kitchen table…. It’s how come we’re well-off\\ntoday. Made a lot of trade-offs … sacrifices early in our marriage.”\\nWhy aren’t you wealthy, you ask? Well, let’s examine your lifestyle. Is it one of great offense? Are\\nyou in the $70,000, $100,000, $200,000 income category? Congratulations, you play wonderful\\noffense. But how is it that you keep losing the game called wealth accumulation?\\nBe honest with yourself. Could it be that you play terrible defense? Most high-income earners are in\\nthe same situation, but not most millionaires. Millionaires play both quality offense and quality\\ndefense. And quite often their great defense helps them outscore/outaccumulate those who\\noutearn/have superior offenses. The foundation stone of wealth accumulation is defense, and this\\ndefense should be anchored by budgeting and planning. We have discovered that several occupational\\ngroups contain large numbers of budgeters and planners.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='AFFLUENT AUCTIONEERS\\nOur latest survey of auctioneers found that more than 35 percent of them are millionaires. This\\npercentage is slightly higher than the proportion of millionaire households living in America’s finest\\nurban and suburban neighborhoods.\\nAuctioneers have been on our list of highly productive types since we conducted our first study of\\noccupations in 1983, when they ranked sixth among those with realized annual incomes of more than\\n$100,000. But their income alone was not what caught our attention. Given the same level of income,\\nwho accumulates more wealth—an auctioneer residing in small-town America or someone who lives\\nin a high-status urban or suburban neighborhood? As you can guess, it is the typical auctioneer.\\nAuctioneers are more frugal than their high-income-producing counterparts in prestige areas; they\\nhave lower overhead both for household and business expenditures. To some extent, these data are\\nexplained by the lower cost of living and doing business in small towns. Yet even when cost of living\\nis taken into account, auctioneers are more prone to accumulate wealth. Consider the following:\\n♦ On average, millionaire auctioneers are about fifty years of age, six to eight years younger than their\\nurban/suburban counterparts.\\n♦ The average millionaire auctioneer spends only 61 percent of the amount urban/suburban\\nmillionaires allocate for housing.\\n♦ Urban/suburban millionaires are more than three times more likely than millionaire auctioneers to\\nown luxury foreign automobiles.\\n♦ Auctioneers hold a higher proportion of their wealth in appreciating assets than do other high-\\nincome producers, and they invest in categories in which they have expertise.\\n♦ Auctioneers have experience with bankruptcy. They are aware that consumer goods often generate\\nfew cents on the dollar. One auctioneer explained why she was so frugal:\\nWhen I was quite young, I watched a woman crying … sitting on a chair in her front\\nyard. All the while, bidders were walking away with everything she once owned. I’ll never\\nforget that woman.\\nLet’s ask the typical American self-made millionaire about her defense. We will refer to her as Mrs.\\nJane Rule. Mrs. Rule and her husband own a small business, an auctioneering/appraising company.\\nThey also invest in several of the categories of items they appraise. Mr. Rule is the visible manager of\\ntheir business. He gets much of the credit for its success. After all, he speaks very well and very\\nquickly. But it’s actually Mrs. Rule who is the true force, the real leader, of this enterprise. It’s her\\nplanning, designing, budgeting, bill collecting, and marketing that made this auctioneering company\\nsuccessful.\\nWhy are Mr. and Mrs. Rule millionaires today? Because Mrs. Rule plays tremendous defense! She\\nis responsible for budgeting and spending for both her household and their business. Is anyone in your\\nhousehold responsible for budgeting? All too often the answer is “not really.” All too often people\\nallow their income to define their budgets. When we tell our audiences about the budgeting and', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='planning habits of the affluent, someone always asks a predictable question: Why would someone who\\nis a millionaire need to budget? Our answer is always the same:\\nThey became millionaires by budgeting and controlling expenses, and they maintain\\ntheir affluent status the same way.\\nSometimes we are forced to add analogies to make our point. We ask, for example:\\nHave you ever noticed those people whom you see jogging day after day? They are the\\nones who seem not to need to jog. But that’s why they are fit. Those who are wealthy work at\\nstaying financially fit. But those who are not financially fit do little to change their status.\\nMost people want to be physically fit. And the majority know what is required to achieve this. But\\ndespite that knowledge, most people never become well conditioned physically. Why not? Because\\nthey don’t have the discipline to just do it. They don’t budget their time to just do it. It is like\\nbecoming wealthy in America. Oh, you want to all right, but you play lousy financial defense. You\\ndon’t have the discipline to control your spending. You don’t take the time to budget or plan. Note that\\nunder accumulators of wealth spend three times as much time exercising per month as they do\\nplanning their investment strategies.\\nMrs. Rule is different. She’s like most millionaires. She’s disciplined. She takes time to plan and\\nbudget. This translates into wealth. Mrs. Rule’s household income varies from year to year. (It is\\ntypical for auctioneers to have ups and downs in their cash flow. Often downturns in our nation’s\\neconomy translate into increased demand for auctioneering services.) Over the past five years her\\nannual income averaged around $90,000. But her net worth keeps increasing. Today Mrs. Rule has a\\nnet worth of more than $2 million. In our survey, she answered “yes” to four questions about planning\\nand budgeting.\\nDo you wish to become affluent and stay affluent? Can you answer “yes” candidly and honestly to\\nfour simple questions?\\nQUESTION 1: DOES YOUR HOUSEHOLD OPERATE ON AN ANNUAL BUDGET?\\nDo you plan your consumption spending according to a variety of food, clothing, and shelter\\ncategories each year? Mrs. Rule does, and so do most millionaires. In fact, in our latest national\\nsurvey of millionaires, we found that for every 100 millionaires who don’t budget, there are about 120\\nwho do.\\nWe anticipate your question about those millionaires who don’t budget. How did they become\\nmillionaires? How do they control spending? They create an artificial economic environment of\\nscarcity for themselves and the other members of their household. More than half of the nonbudgeters\\ninvest first and spend the balance of their income. Many call this the “pay yourself first” strategy.\\nThese people invest a minimum of 15 percent of their annual realized income before they pay the\\nsellers of their food, clothes, homes, credit, and the like.\\nWhat about those millionaires who don’t budget or create an environment of relative scarcity?', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Some inherited all or most of their wealth. Another minority, accounting for fewer than 20 percent of\\nmillionaires, typically earn such high incomes that to some extent they can eat their income and still\\nhave a seven-figure net worth. In other words, their extraordinarily good offense compensates for a\\nlack of defense. But so what if you earn $2 million a year and have a net worth of $1 million?\\nTechnically you’re a millionaire. But spiritually you’re an under accumulator of wealth. And it’s\\nlikely that your millionaire status is temporary. These are the people you read about in the newspaper.\\nThe press loves to tout freaks of both nature and economics.\\nWill the popular press ever do a story on Mrs. Rule? It’s unlikely. Who wants to read about Mrs.\\nRule’s $140,000 home or her four-year-old “Detroit metal” sedan? Who wants to see her sitting at the\\nkitchen table three nights in a row, putting together her family’s annual budget? Is there anything\\nexciting about computing and accounting for each dollar spent last year? Would you be thrilled to\\nwatch Mrs. Rule compute and allocate future dollars of income into dozens of consumption\\ncategories? How long could you stand to watch her carefully complete her annual allocations\\ncalendar? Well, it’s not fun for Mrs. Rule, either. But in Mrs. Rule’s mind there are worse things, such\\nas never being able to retire and never being financially independent. It’s much easier to budget if you\\nvisualize the long-term benefits of this task.\\nQUESTION 2: DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR FAMILY SPENDS EACH YEAR FOR\\nFOOD, CLOTHING, AND SHELTER?\\nAlmost two-thirds of the millionaires surveyed (62.4 percent) answered “yes” to this question. So did\\nMrs. Rule. But only about 35 percent of high-income-producing nonmillionaires answered “yes” to\\nthis question. Many of these high-income/low-net worth types have no idea how much they spend each\\nyear for such items as food consumed at home, food consumed away from home, beverages, birthday\\nand holiday gifts (for each category of recipient), each category of clothing for each household\\nmember at each store, baby-sitters, day-care fees, line of credit use, charitable contributions, financial\\nadvice, club dues, motor vehicles and related expenses, tuition, vacations, heating and lighting, and\\ninsurance.\\nNotice that we did not include mortgage payments in our list. Often high-income/low-net worth\\nrespondents boast about how much money they save on taxes via their mortgage deductions. Certainly\\nmost millionaires who have mortgages outstanding also take advantage of this provision. But most\\nmillionaires also account for their other categories of domestic expenditures. Ask typical high-\\nincome/low-net worth people about their goals. What will they tell you? A major goal they often name\\nis to minimize their tax burden; they use the mortgage deduction as a way to accomplish this. Then\\nwhy don’t these same people compute their other domestic expenditures? Simply because they do not\\nperceive any value in doing so. As they see it, most of their domestic spending is not deductible in\\ncomputing one’s taxable income.\\nBut Mrs. Rule sees things differently. Her goal is to become financially independent—in her case,\\nto have $5 million by the time she and her husband retire. She believes that budgeting and accounting\\nfor domestic consumption is directly related to achieving this goal. In her view, tabulating helps\\ncontrol consumption. It also reduces the probability of allocating too many dollars to product and\\nservice categories that are not really important. Mrs. Rule has always tabulated expenditures for her\\nbusiness. She realizes that the same system she used for business accounting can be used for domestic\\npurposes. This is an advantage of being a self-employed business owner.\\nMrs. Rule wants to be free of financial worry before her sixty-fifth birthday. Each time she', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='tabulates, she tells herself she is reducing herfear of never being able to retire in comfort. Who has\\nconcern about their financial future? Not Mrs. Rule. Although she has an annual income of $90,000,\\nshe’s worth more than twenty times that amount. And she is in control of her household’s domestic\\nspending.\\nRobert and Judy, on the other hand, are frightened. And they should be. This couple earns $200,000\\nannually, or more than twice what Mrs. Rule earns. Yet, like so many of today’s high-income-\\nproducing couples, Robert and Judy have only a fraction of Mrs. Rule’s wealth. They feel that\\nconsumption controls them, not the other way around. Even Mrs. Rule might find it daunting to have\\nto account for $200,000 in expenditures each year. Robert and Judy have fourteen credit cards; the\\nRules have two (one for business use, the other for domestic spending).\\nLet’s talk about credit cards for a moment. Ask a large sample of millionaires a simple question\\nabout their credit cards. The results will give you an excellent idea of who these millionaires really\\nare.\\nMr./Mrs. Millionaire:\\nPlease indicate, by circling the appropriate number, the credit cards that you or any\\nmember of your house possesses. Circle all those that apply.\\nNow close your eyes and pretend you are a millionaire with a net worth of nearly $4 million. What\\ncredit cards would be congruent with your station in life? Perhaps at the top of your list would be\\nAmerican Express Platinum, Diners Club, or Carte Blanche. Perhaps you consider yourself a fashion-\\nsensitive millionaire. You may list credit cards from Brooks Brothers, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth\\nAvenue, Lord & Taylor, or even Eddie Bauer. You would be in the minority of millionaires if you did\\nlist these cards. The results from our national survey of millionaires reveal some interesting credit\\ncard preferences (see Table 2-2). Some highlights:\\n♦ Like most American households, most wealthy households have a MasterCard and a Visa card.\\n♦ The millionaire household is four times more likely to hold a Sears card (43 percent) than a Brooks\\nBrothers card (10 percent).\\n♦ Both Sears and Penney’s cards are significantly more popular among the wealthy than the cards of\\nstatus retailers.\\n♦ Only 21 percent of the wealthy households in America hold the Neiman Marcus card; 25 percent,\\nSaks Fifth Avenue; 25 percent, Lord & Taylor; and only 8.1 percent, the Eddie Bauer card.\\n♦ Only 6.2 percent of the millionaire respondents hold the American Express Platinum card; 3.4\\npercent hold Diners Club; and fewer than 1 percent own Carte Blanche.\\nTABLE 2-2\\nCREDIT CARDS OF MILLIONAIRE HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS (N=385)', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='CREDIT CARD PERCENT POSSESSING\\nVisa 59.0\\nMasterCard 56.0\\nSears 43.0\\nPenney’s 30.4\\nAmerican Express Gold 28.6\\nAmerican Express Green 26.2\\nLord & Taylor 25.0\\nSaks Fifth Avenue 25.0\\nNeiman Marcus 21.0\\nBrooks Brothers 10.0\\nEddie Bauer 8.1\\nAmerican Express Platinum 6.2\\nDiners Club 3.4\\nCarte Blanche 0.9\\nQUESTION 3: DO YOU HAVE A CLEARLY DEFINED SET OF DAILY, WEEKLY,\\nMONTHLY, ANNUAL, AND LIFETIME GOALS?\\nThe source of this question came from a decamillionaire whom we interviewed a dozen years ago. He\\ntold us that he started a wholesale food business at the age of nineteen. He never finished formal high\\nschool but did eventually receive his high school equivalency diploma. We asked him to account for\\nthe fact that although he was a high school dropout, he had accumulated over $10 million. His\\nresponse was as follows:\\nI have always been goal-oriented. I have a clearly defined set of daily goals, weekly\\ngoals, monthly goals, annual goals, and lifetime goals. I even have goals to go to the\\nbathroom. I always tell our young executives that they must have goals.\\nMrs. Rule also is goal-oriented. So are most other millionaires. For every 100 millionaires who\\nanswered “no” to this question, there are 180 who answered “yes.” Who are the “noes”? Many of the\\nhigh-income and inherited-wealth types discussed in the last section. Many senior citizens and retired\\nmillionaires who have already reached most of their goals also answered “no.” You may wish to\\nreflect for a moment on the comments made by an eighty-year-old multimillionaire:\\nAuthors: The first question we always ask is about goals. What are your current goals?\\nMr. Clark: It was $438 an ounce yesterday in London!', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='After Mr. Clark turned on his hearing aid, we repeated the question.\\nMr. Clark: Oh, goals, not gold…. I see. My goals. I’ve accomplished what I’ve tried to\\ndo…. My long-range goal was, of course, to accumulate enough wealth so I can get out of\\nbusiness and enjoy life. I’ve been down the road…. I’ve got an international reputation.\\nMine is one of the greatest welding companies in the world. I never want to retire. But now\\nmy goal is my family and self-satisfaction about what I’ve accomplished.\\nMr. Clark is typical of seniors who have accumulated significant wealth. By the way, only two\\nmillionaires of all those we interviewed ever told us that their goal was to “spend my last dollar the\\nday that I die!”\\nNeither Mr. Clark nor Mrs. Rule has such a goal. Mrs. Rule plans to leave educational trusts for all\\nher grandchildren. She also wants to enjoy life now and after she retires. She wants to be financially\\nsecure. Her financial goal is to accumulate $5 million. Mrs. Rule knows how much she needs to set\\naside each year to attain her goals.\\nBut is she happy? That’s a question very often asked of us regarding frugal millionaires. Yes, she is\\nhappy. She is financially secure. Mrs. Rule enjoys being part of a close-knit family. Her family is\\neverything to her. Her life and her goals are simple. Mrs. Rule does not need a CPA to do her goal-\\nplanning for her, although she does seek his counsel in regard to both her domestic and business-\\nrelated needs. But Robert and Judy, our high-income/low-net worth couple, are in dire need of a strong\\nand intelligent guiding hand. They need a CPA who has considerable experience in changing his\\nclients’ orientations, one who will help them change their household environment from one of chaos\\nand hyperconsumption to one of goal-oriented planning, budgeting, and controlling. Will they then be\\nhappy? We don’t know, but we can tell you this:\\nFinancially independent people are happier than those in their same income/age cohort\\nwho are not financially secure.\\nFinancially independent people seem to be better able to visualize the future benefits of defining their\\ngoals. Mrs. Rule, for instance, visualizes all her grandchildren graduating from college. She visualizes\\ntheir success after college. She never sees herself being financially dependent on others, even if she is\\ndisabled in the future. Her goals are congruent with those of most millionaires in this regard.\\nQUESTION 4: DO YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME PLANNING YOUR FINANCIAL FUTURE?\\nFor every 100 millionaires who answer “no,” there are 192 who answer “yes.” Again, many who\\nanswer “no” are either high-income types with relatively low levels of accumulated wealth, those who\\ninherited all or most of their wealth, or wealthy seniors/retirees.\\nPeople such as Mrs. Rule accurately label themselves as planners. In fact, the responses to this\\nquestion are highly correlated to the actual hours the respondents allocate to planning their financial', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='futures. On average, millionaires spend significantly more hours per month studying and planning\\ntheir future investment decisions, as well as managing their current investments, than high-income\\nnonmillionaires. The hours allocated to planning and managing finances are detailed in Chapter 3.\\nMillionaires like Mrs. Rule not only spend more time planning their finances than nonmillionaires,\\nthey also seem to get more out of their planning hours. Remember, Mrs. Rule is not only in the\\nauctioneering business. Her job includes appraising the value of what her company auctions. Often\\nMrs. Rule invests in those same areas in which she has considerable expertise. In this regard she is\\nlike many millionaires. They astutely allocate their time so that they can plan their business and\\npersonal investing at the same time. We often find that highly productive auctioneers are also\\nexcellent investors. Take, for example, an auctioneer who specializes in auctioning commercial real\\nestate. What area of investments does he know a great deal about? Commercial real estate. He is his\\nown investment analyst. What if your auctioneering specialty is antique furniture and American\\nfirearms? Should you invest in high-tech securities? Probably not. But you would be wise to use your\\nexpertise to help you make your investments. If you’re well versed in antiques, why not leverage your\\nknowledge?\\nYou don’t have to be an auctioneer to benefit from your knowledge. One of our associates was\\nformerly the head of strategic planning at a major corporation. Part of his job was to study a wide\\nvariety of trends across a wide variety of business categories. Years ago he discovered that the\\ndemand for investment-grade baseball cards would likely explode someday. This was long before the\\nmarket reflected this trend. He invested heavily when the market was “asleep,” in his words. And he\\nsold out all his holdings—including all his Mickey Mantle rookie cards—at the top of the market.\\nAnother acquaintance, a manager of a department store, always studied trade journals to learn how to\\nmake his store more productive. Later he leveraged his reading habits into investing in growth stocks\\nin the retailing area.\\nHow much time do nonmillionaires allocate to planning and managing? Not enough! As previously\\nstated, much less than millionaires. Although millionaires have much more experience in making\\ninvestment decisions, they allocate significantly more hours than do nonmillionaires in an effort to\\nbecome even better investors. That is one of the main reasons that millionaires remain wealthy.\\nBusiness owners like Mrs. Rule certainly have more freedom than people who are not self-\\nemployed. She can and does leverage her business knowledge with her personal investing habits. She\\ncan pick her area of business and the one she wants to study. Often employees don’t have this luxury.\\nBut even among those who do have significant knowledge about excellent investment opportunities,\\nmany do not leverage this knowledge. Consider the following examples:\\n♦ A highly productive sales professional (we will call him Mr. Willis) had Wal-Mart as a client for\\nmore than ten years. All during this time, Wal-Mart was exploding in growth and value. How many\\nshares of Wal-Mart did Mr. Willis, the six-figure-earning sales professional, ever purchase? Zero.\\nYes, zero, even though he had considerable firsthand knowledge of his client’s success and an annual\\nsix-figure income. But he did purchase a foreign luxury car every two years during this time.\\n♦ A high-income-producing marketing manager, Mr. Petersen, was employed in the high-tech field.\\nBut he never invested a dollar in Microsoft or any other growth company. Never, in spite of having\\nconsiderable knowledge about many of the firms in the technology industry.\\n♦ The owner of a printing business enjoyed having one of the leading beverage companies in America\\nas a customer. The customer bought millions of dollars’ worth of printing from him annually. But how\\nmuch money has the printer invested in his customer’s equity offerings? Zero.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='In all three cases, the person makes a higher income than does Mrs. Rule. Yet none is a millionaire.\\nIn fact, Mr. Petersen, the marketing manager, has zero invested in stocks. He never invests any of his\\nincome. But he lives in a $400,000 home that is surrounded by others in the high-tech field who have\\nbig hats and bigger mortgages, but nocattle. Too many high-income/low-net worth types live from\\npaycheck to paycheck, fearing a sudden downturn in our economy.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='OUR FRIEND THE UAW\\nWhat motivates Theodore “Teddy” J. Friend? Why does he work so hard? Why is he driven to earn so\\nmuch money? Why does he spend so much? Teddy will tell you it’s because he’s competitive. But so\\nare almost all top-producing sales professionals. His competitiveness is not the most important reason\\nfor his behavior.\\nWhen Teddy was growing up, his family was among the poorest in a blue-collar community. His\\nfamily’s small home was built from used lumber and similar discarded materials. Until Teddy was a\\nfreshman in high school, his father cut Teddy’s hair, which did save money, although, according to\\nTeddy, most people could tell that his “head was worked on by an amateur.”\\nThe public high school he attended attracted students from a wide variety of socioeconomic\\nbackgrounds. Many were from upscale homes. “Rich kids” were there in large enough numbers to fill\\nthe high school’s parking lot with their nice cars. These cars always amazed Mr. Friend. Throughout\\nhigh school his family owned one automobile. It was a well-used Ford that his dad had bought when it\\nwas ten years old.\\nDuring his high school years, Mr. Friend made a promise to himself that someday he would be a lot\\nbetter off than his parents. “Better off” in his mind meant having a nice home in an upscale\\nneighborhood, fine clothes for everyone in his family, classy cars, club memberships, and items\\npurchased in the best stores. Mr. Friend realized that “better off” could be achieved by finding a high-\\npaying position and working very hard.\\nNever did Mr. Friend equate “better off” with accumulating wealth. Again, being “better off” meant\\ndisplaying one’s high income via the conspicuous display of high-status artifacts. Teddy never gave\\nmuch thought to the benefits of building an investment portfolio. To him, a high income was the way\\nto overcome a feeling of social inferiority. A high income was the product of hard work. “Income in\\nthe form of capital gains” were foreign words to him.\\nMr. Friend’s father and mother were dysfunctional when it came toputting money away for a rainy\\nday. Their financial plan was very simple: They spent when they had money. They stopped spending\\nwhen they ran short of money. If they needed something, such as a washing machine or a new roof,\\nthey saved for it. But they also bought many items with installment loans. They never owned any\\nstocks or bonds. Never did Teddy’s parents set aside income for investment purposes. They did not\\nunderstand or trust the stock market. The only real financial wealth the couple had was a small\\npension and the equity in their very modest home.\\nToday their son has a need to compensate for his “primitive blue-collar” background and his\\nperceived educational deficiency. Mr. Friend never completed college. Even now he feels compelled\\nto outperform all the college graduates against whom he competes. He will tell you that he enjoys\\ndressing better, driving better, dwelling better, and, in general, living higher than all those “college\\nkids” who operate within his territory.\\nMr. Friend is the ultimate consumer. He has two boats, one jet ski, and six automobiles (two are\\nleased; the others were purchased via credit). Interestingly, there are only three drivers in his\\nhousehold. He is a member of two country clubs and wears a watch that cost more than $5,000. He\\nbuys his clothes from the best stores. Mr. Friend also “owns” a vacation condo.\\nLast year Mr. Friend’s income was approximately $221,000. Given his age, forty-eight, what is his\\nexpected net worth? According to our wealth equation, his net worth should be $1,060,800 (expected\\nwealth = one-tenth age x total annual income). What is his real net worth? Less than one-fourth of the\\nexpected figure.\\nHow is it possible that Mr. Friend has an actual net worth that is less than one-fourth of the', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='expected value? The answer lies in how Mr. Friend thinks. Wealth accumulation is not what motivates\\nhim. Interestingly, Mr. Friend firmly believes that if he were really wealthy he would not be a top-\\nincome generator. He has often stated that people who come from wealthy backgrounds have little\\nmotivation to excel in the workplace.\\nMr. Friend has found a method to sustain and even enhance his drive to perform at high levels. He\\nhas found that fear is a great motivator. So he buys more and more via credit. By increasing the\\namount he owes, he correspondingly increases the accountant’s fear of default. In turn, this increasing\\nlevel of debt-based fear encourages him to workharder and more aggressively. To him, a big home is a\\nreminder of a big mortgage and the need to perform at a high level.\\nMr. Friend is not a big spender across all categories of products and services. Ask him how much\\nmoney he allocates for financial advice. In this category he is very price-sensitive. For example, his\\nchoice of an accountant was based almost exclusively on the accountant’s fees, not on his quality. Mr.\\nFriend has always believed that the quality of service that accountants deliver is about the same; only\\ntheir fees are different. That’s why he picked an accountant who has low fees. In sharp contrast, most\\nwealthy people feel that you get what you pay for in the realm of financial advice.\\nMr. Friend spends a considerable amount of time working. Still, he constantly worries that he will\\nlose his so-called competitive edge. He is concerned that his need to outperform the rich kids, the\\ncollege graduates, will wane someday. Mr. Friend constantly reminds himself about his humble\\nbackground and lack of that all-important college degree. He constantly punishes himself\\npsychologically. In his eyes he is inferior in pedigree to those very confident college graduates against\\nwhom he competes. He often wonders how they can be so content, given their less-than-exceptional\\nperformance in the workplace.\\nMr. Friend never really enjoys his life. He owns a lot of upscale things, yet he works so hard and for\\nso many hours during a typical day that he has no time to enjoy them. He has no time for his family,\\neither. He leaves his house each day before dawn and rarely returns home in time for dinner.\\nWould you like to be Mr. Friend? His lifestyle is appealing to many people. But if these people\\nreally understood Mr. Friend’s inner workings, they might evaluate him differently. Mr. Friend is\\npossessed by possessions. He works for things. His motivation and his thoughts are focused on the\\nsymbols of economic success. He constantly needs to convince others of this success. Unhappily, he\\nhas never convinced himself. In essence, he works, he earns, and he sacrifices to impress others.\\nThese factors underlie the thought processes of many under accumulators of wealth. More often\\nthan not, UAWs allow “significant others” to determine their financial lifestyle. Interestingly, these\\n“significant others,” or reference groups, turn out to be more imagined than real. Are you motivated\\nby “significant others”? Perhaps you should consider a different approach to life. Perhaps you should\\nreorient yourself.\\nAre all high-income people who came from humble beginningsdestined to become UAWs? Will\\nthey all turn out to follow the ways of Mr. Friend? Absolutely not. There is a fundamental reason\\nbeyond Mr. Friend’s perceived social and educational deficiencies that explains why he became a\\nUAW: His parents taught him the ways of the UAW. In spite of their modest income, his parents were\\nnot frugal. They spent nearly all their income. They were professionals in expending resources. Any\\npending increase in income was immediately earmarked for consumption. Even anticipated income\\ntax refunds were allocated for consumption—long before the checks were received. Their consumer\\nbehavior had an impact on their son. They constantly sent him a message:\\nOne earns to spend.\\nWhen you need to spend more, you need to earn more.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='LIFE AMONG FRIENDS\\nHow did Mr. Friend’s parents spend their money? He told us that throughout their marriage they ate a\\nlot, smoked a lot, drank a lot, and shopped a lot. Their household was always overloaded with food.\\nThey stockpiled snack foods, prime meats, cold cuts, ice creams, and other desserts. Even breakfast\\nwas a feast. Bacon, sausage, home fries, eggs, English muffins, and Danish pastries were basics in the\\nmorning. Steaks and roasts were the preferred dinner offerings. The Friends never skipped a meal.\\nNeighbors and relatives were frequent guests at the “Friends’ Restaurant,” as they referred to their\\nhome. Mr. Friend’s parents, between them, smoked about three packs of cigarettes a day. During a\\nnormal week they consumed two cases of beer. On holidays, consumption of food, tobacco, and\\nalcohol greatly increased.\\nShopping and consuming were the Friends’ main hobbies. More often than not, they shopped for\\nfun, not necessity. On most Saturdays they would shop from the early morning until mid-afternoon.\\nFirst they shopped for food. Then they spent countless hours shopping in discount stores. Mr. Friend\\npointed out that “most of the stuff they bought was junk.”\\nHis mother was an especially aggressive discount store shopper. She had a strong proclivity for\\npurchasing large quantities of throw rugs, ashtrays, malted milk balls, caramel corn, towels of every\\ncolor andstyle, casual shoes, wooden bowls, and cooking utensils. Many of these items were\\nstockpiled, sometimes for years, before they were used. His father was also a recreational shopper. He\\nspent hours each Saturday shopping for tools and hardware. In most cases, these items were rarely, if\\never, used.\\nClearly, Mr. Friend’s parents were UAWs. He was well trained. But today he generates a much\\nhigher income than his parents ever earned. Why is he still a UAW? This income, in itself, is a result\\nof parental guidance. His dad often told him to seek a job with high-income potential. To do so would\\nenable Mr. Friend to buy the finer things in life. His father’s message was clear: To purchase a fine\\nhome, luxury automobiles, and expensive clothing, one has to earn a large income. Mr. Friend found\\nthat several areas of the sales profession had excellent income-producing opportunities. He would\\nhave to earn big to spend big. No mention was ever made of the value of putting money aside for\\ninvesting. Income was designed to be spent. Credit was used heavily for major purchases.\\nMr. Friend and his parents have never appreciated the benefits of accumulating wealth via\\ninvesting. Mr. Friend told us repeatedly that “it’s hopeless.” He just does not have any money to\\ninvest! How is it that someone with an income six times the average for American households has no\\nmoney to invest? Mr. Friend spends more annually for his children’s private school and college tuition\\nthan the average household earns in a year. He has an inventory of automobiles that is valued in excess\\nof $130,000. He pays more than $12,000 each year for property taxes. His total annual mortgage\\npayments are in excess of $30,000. Several of his suits cost $1,200 each.\\nBut his insensitivity to the benefits of investing go beyond his need to consume. His parents had no\\nunderstanding or appreciation of invested dollars. Nor does he. And his parents passed this lack of\\nwisdom on to him.\\nMr. Friend argues that his parents were people of modest means, people with no money to invest.\\nLet’s examine this perception. His parents smoked three packs of cigarettes each day. How many\\npacks did they consume during their adult lifetimes? There are 365 days in a year. So they consumed', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='approximately 1,095 packs per year. They smoked for approximately forty-six years. So in forty-six\\nyears, they smoked 50,370 packs of cigarettes. How much did the couple pay for these cigarettes?\\nApproximately $33,190—more than the purchaseprice of their home! They never considered how\\nmuch it cost to purchase cigarettes. They viewed such purchases as small expenses. But small\\nexpenses become big expenses over time. Small amounts invested periodically also become large\\ninvestments over time.\\nWhat if the Friends had invested their cigarette money in the stock market (index fund) during their\\nlifetimes? How much would it have been worth? Nearly $100,000. And what if they had used their\\ncigarette money to purchase shares in a tobacco company? What if they had purchased, reinvested all\\ndividends, and never sold shares in Philip Morris instead of smoking Philip Morris products for forty-\\nsix years? At the end of forty-six years, the couple would have had a tobacco portfolio worth over $2\\nmillion. But the couple, like their son, never imagined that “small change” could be transformed into\\nsignificant wealth.\\nThis change in behavior alone would have placed the Friends in the millionaire category. They\\nwould have been members of the PAW group, too, given their modest income. Perhaps they would\\nhave lived differently if someone had educated them about the mathematics of wealth appreciation.\\nNo one told them about this phenomenon. So it is not surprising that they failed to educate their son\\nabout the benefits of investing. But they did tell him not to smoke. His dad told him, “Don’t ever put\\nthe first cigarette in your mouth. I’m hooked. There is nothing I can do to quit.” His son followed this\\nadvice.\\nKICKING THE UAW HABIT\\nHow long will Mr. Friend be able to fund his lifestyle? What if he were to stop working today? How\\nlong could he live off his current level of wealth? Only for about a year! No wonder he works so hard.\\nGiven his current circumstances, Mr. Friend will never be able to retire in comfort. In spite of being\\nnearly fifty years of age, he has yet to figure this out for himself. But all is not hopeless. Mr. Friend\\ncan still become an accumulator of wealth.\\nWe find that it is often useful for UAWs to be told the naked truth: “Friend, you’re worth less than\\none-half of the expected amount for those in your incomelage group “ Such news can spur on UAWs\\nwho are competitive. How do they respond when told that their net worth places them in the bottom\\nquartile for all people with similar income and age characteristics? Some are incredulous. Many want\\nto change\\nbut are uncertain how to transform themselves. How can someone change when they have more than\\ntwenty years’ experience as a UAW?\\nFirst, they must really want to change. Second, they will likely need some professional help.\\nIdeally, they need to find a certified public accountant who provides financial planning. A\\nprofessional of this type should have considerable experience and success with transforming UAWs.\\nThat is, they should have a strong track record in helping the Mr. Friends of the world become more\\nPAW-like.\\nIn extreme cases, a CPA/financial planner actually takes control of his client’s purchasing behavior.\\nHe first audits the client’s consumption habits over the past two years. He categorizes and tabulates\\neach element. Then the accountant consults with the client. The client is put into a “cold turkey”\\ncutback program, meaning that all elements of consumption are reduced by a minimum of 15 percent\\nfor the next year or two. Additional cutbacks follow. In some situations, the accountant/financial', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='planner even keeps his client’s checkbooks, writes all the checks, and pays all the bills.

But sometimes it’s the only way to solve the problem.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='THE ULTIMATE CONSUMPTION CATEGORY\\nThe typical millionaire in our surveys has a total annual realized income of less than 7 percent of his\\nwealth. This means that less than 7 percent of his wealth is subject to some form of income tax.* In\\nour latest study of millionaires, the percentage was found to be 6.7 percent. Millionaires know that the\\nmore they spend, the more income they must realize. The more they realize, the more they must\\nallocate for income taxes. So millionaires and those who will likely become affluent in the future\\nadhere to an important rule:\\nTo build wealth, minimize your realized (taxable) income and maximize your unrealized\\nincome (wealth/capital appreciation without a cash flow).\\nIncome tax is the single largest annual expenditure for most households. It is tax on income, not on\\nwealth and not on the appreciation of wealth if this appreciation is not realized; that is, if it does not\\ngenerate a cash flow.\\nWhat is the message? Even many high-income-producing households are asset poor. One reason is\\nthat they maximize their realized incomes, often to support high-consumption lifestyles. Such people\\nmight wish to ask themselves a simple question: Could I live on the equivalent of 6.7 percent of my\\nwealth? It takes much discipline to become affluent. We have interviewed many people worth $2 or $3\\nmillion who have total realized annual household incomes of less than $80,000.\\nHow much does the typical American household realize in income each year? About $35,000 to\\n$40,000, or nearly the equivalent of 90 percent of its net worth. The result is that the typical household\\nin America pays the equivalent of more than 10 percent of its wealth in income taxes each year. How\\nabout the millionaires whom we surveyed? On average, their annual income tax bill is an amount\\nequal to only a bit over 2 percent of their wealth. That is one of the reasons they remain financially\\nindependent.\\nCASE STUDY: SHARON AND BARBARA\\nSharon is a high-income-producing health-care specialist. She recently asked us, “How is it that I\\nmake so much in terms of income but accumulate so little in terms of wealth?”\\nLast year Sharon’s household had a realized total annual income of approximately $220,000 (see\\nTable 2-3), which places her household in the top 1 percent of all households in America. Sharon’s\\nhousehold has a net worth of approximately $370,000. While Sharon’s income is higher than 99\\npercent of the other households in America, her net worth is far below what it should be. Given her\\nage, fifty-one, and her income, $220,000, Sharon should, according to the wealth equation (expected\\nnet worth = one-tenth age × income), be worth approximately $1,122,000.\\nWhy is Sharon’s level of accumulated wealth far below the norm? Because her realized, or taxable,\\nincome is too high. Last year she paid $69,440 in federal tax on her $220,000 income. This is the\\nequivalent of 18.8 percent of her total wealth. Yogi Berra might say, “Sharon, you can’t be wealthy.\\nYour income is too high.”', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='TABLE 2-3\\nCONTRASTS AMONG AMERICAN TAXPAYERS\\nWe believe that the average person in Sharon’s income/age category pays the equivalent of only 6.2\\npercent of his wealth in annual federal tax, or $69,440 divided by $1,122,000. Thus, Sharon’s tax\\nequivalent, 18.8 percent of her wealth, is three times higher than the tax equivalent for the average\\nperson in her income/age category.\\nTo view this another way, Sharon has an annual realized income that is equivalent to 59.5 percent of\\nher total net worth of $370,000. How could anyone hope to become truly wealthy when the equivalent\\nof nearly 60 percent of her wealth is subject to income tax each year? The average person in Sharon’s\\nincome/age category realizes the equivalent of only 19.6 percent of his net worth in annual income.\\nThus, only about $1 in $5 of his net worth is subject to income tax.\\nWhat about people who have above-average levels of wealth?

Her realized annual income\\nis approximately the same as Sharon’s—$220,000. But Barbara’s net worth is approximately\\n$3,550,000.

In\\nsharp contrast, Sharon paid the equivalent of 18.8 percent of her wealth in federal income tax, or more\\nthan nine times the percentage for Barbara.\\nThe average American millionaire realizes significantly less than 10 percent of his net worth in\\nannual income. In spite of having considerable wealth and substantial annual increases in wealth (in\\nunrealized form), the typical American millionaire may personally be cash poor. More than 20 percent\\nof Barbara’s annual realized income is invested in financial assets that tend to appreciate in value\\nwithout generating realized income. Sharon, on the other hand, invests less than 3 percent of her\\nrealized income. Most of her financial assets are in liquid form.\\nSharon’s economic situation is quite risky. She is the main breadwinner in her household, which has\\nlittle investment income. If her employer eliminates her job, what then? There are not too many\\npositions available today that pay $200,000 or more a year. Barbara, again in contrast to Sharon, has a\\nbusiness with more than sixteen hundred customers—that’s sixteen hundred sources of income. This\\nis much less risky than Sharon’s position. Sharon could not survive for six monthsif she lost her\\nsource of income. But Barbara could easily survive for twenty or more years. Actually, she could\\nretire at this point on the income from her financial assets alone.\\nBarbara, the prodigious accumulator of wealth, is just one of more than 3.5 million millionaires in\\nAmerica today. More than 90 percent have a net worth between $1 million and $10 million. How do\\nthese affluent people compare with the super-affluent? Indications are that the higher one’s net worth,\\nthe better one is at minimizing one’s realized income. The fact is that the super-affluent got to that\\nposition by being masters at minimizing their realized income.\\nRoss Perot is the perfect example of how the super-affluent stay affluent and even enhance their\\nlevels of wealth year after year. Forbes recently estimated that Mr. Perot’s net worth was $2.4 billion\\n(see Randall Lane, “What’s Ross Perot Really Worth,” Forbes, October 19, 1992, p. 72). The Citizens\\nfor Tax Justice, a tax reform group headquartered in Washington, D.C., estimated that Perot’s annual\\nrealized income in 1995 was approximately $230 million. Thus, he realized the equivalent of 9.6\\npercent of his wealth but paid only $19.5 million in tax, or 8.5 percent of his income (see “How Perot\\nCaps His Rising Taxes at Only 8.5%,” Money, January 1994, p. 18). Compare this figure with the 31.6\\npercent of their income paid in tax by Barbara, Sharon, and many others in their income category (see\\nTable 2-3).\\nHow does Mr. Perot end up paying such a small percentage of his income in tax? According to a\\nrecent newspaper report:\\nPerot… minimizes his tax bill by investing heavily in taxfree municipals, tax-sheltered\\nreal estate, and stocks with unrealized gains (Tom Walker, “Perot’s Tax Rate Is Lower Than\\nMost, Magazine Says,” Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Dec. 30, 1993, p. 1).\\nOf particular interest, Perot’s tax rate as a percentage of his income—that is, 8.5 percent—is lower\\nthan that of the average American household. The average household in this country pays $4,248 in\\nfederal income tax each year, or the equivalent of 12.9 percent of their annual realized income of\\n$32,823.

He gives you an assignment: to enhance his\\nunderstanding of the relationship between income and wealth.\\nMr. Young: Bob, I keep reading reports about the growth of the millionaire population.\\nMr. Stern: Yes. I have a pile of articles and clippings on the same topic in my desk.\\nMr. Young: Well, here is the problem. The number of wealthy people keeps rapidly\\nincreasing. But our income tax revenue for a lot of these people is not keeping pace.\\nMr. Stern: I read somewhere that the wealthiest 3.5 percent of the households in this\\ncountry account for more than half of the personal wealth. But these same folks account for\\nless than 30 percent of the income.\\nMr. Young: I wish Congress would wake up.

Are they good role models for our youth?\\nMr. Young: Absolutely. They are high-income spenders. They tell our youth to earn and\\nspend. It’s realized income that our youth need to learn about.

Many\\nwell-trained economists and other scholars who work for our government frequently conduct studies\\nabout the rich (or, as they refer to them, the “top wealth holders”). We are particularly interested in\\nthe articles published in the Internal Revenue Service’s Statistics of Income, a quarterly report.

Eugene Steuerle is assistant director of the Office of Tax Analysis in the U.S. Department of the\\nTreasury. He is also a scholar and talented researcher. He asks the same question we do: What is “the\\nrelationship between realized income and wealth”? (SOI Bulletin, Department of the Treasury,\\nInternal Revenue Service, vol. 2, no. 4, Spring 1985) What does he find? That people accumulate\\nsignificant wealth by minimizing their realized/taxable income and maximizing their\\nunrealized/nontaxable income.\\nIn the study that Mr. Steuerle conducted, he compared the income tax returns that top wealth\\nholders filed while they were alive with the estate returns their executors filed after the subjects\\npassed away. He studied a national sample of estate tax returns. Then he matched each of these with\\ntheir respective income tax returns from previous years. Why all this contrasting? Mr. Steuerle wanted\\nto study the correlation between realized income as documented in income tax returns and the actual\\nnet worth of each subject in the sample. Of special interest was the relationship between realized\\nincome generated from investments and their actual market value.\\nWhy would a scholar who works for our treasury department spend so much time conducting a\\nstudy like this? We consider the staff of the IRS a clever bunch. They study their target market. And\\nthey lust for its wealth. They want to know how many affluent people generate so few dollars of\\nrealized income. Since owners of closely held businesses are especially adept at this strategy, Mr.\\nSteuerle selected for study those estates in which the value of the closely held business(es) exceeded\\n65 percent of the estates.\\nHere are some of the findings of Mr. Steuerle’s study:\\n♦ The income realized from the assets of closely held businesses was only 1.15 percent of the\\nappraised value of the assets. Note that even this small percentage is likely to be biased in the upward\\ndirection, since there are estate tax advantages for heirs and executors who provide conservative\\nappraisals.\\n♦ The total income realized from all assets and all salary, wages, and income combined was only 3.66\\npercent of the value of all assets.\\nWhat do these results tell you about the affluent? They suggest that a business owner who is worth,\\nsay, $2 million on average has an annual realized income of only $73,200, or 3.66 percent of $2\\nmillion. Could you live on $73,200 today and still invest a minimum of 15 percent each year? No, it’s\\nnot easy.

Are the results of the surveys we conducted different than those generated from income\\ntax and estate tax returns? You will recall that, on average, the millionaires in our latest survey had a\\ntotal realized income that was about 6.7 percent of their total net worth. The results from the income\\ntax and estate tax data, however, indicated that top wealth holders realized only 3.66 percent of their\\nwealth. How can this difference be explained? And what does it mean?\\nWe employed a different sampling method than that used by the IRSin its study of income tax and\\nestate tax returns. Our survey was based on sampling households that resided in high-status\\nneighborhoods, whereas the IRS sampled from all income tax and estate tax returns. Since about half\\nof the millionaires in America today do not live in so-called high-status neighborhoods, we also\\nsurveyed affluent farmers, auctioneers, and other wealthy people who live in nonstatus neighborhoods.\\nWhy do millionaires from high-status areas realize significantly more of their wealth (6.7 percent)\\nthan those top wealth holders selected from a national sample of all affluent decedents (3.66 percent)?\\nBecause the millionaires from high-status neighborhoods have to realize more income to live in these\\nareas. What are the implications of our findings? It’s easier to accumulate wealth if you don’t live in a\\nhigh-status neighborhood. But even those millionaires who do live in high-status areas realize only\\n6.7 percent of their wealth each year. Think of their non-affluent neighbors who, on average, must\\nconstantly realize more than 40 percent of their wealth just for the joy of living in a high-status gulch.\\nPerhaps you aren’t as wealthy as you should be because you traded much of your current and future\\nincome just for the privilege of living in a home in a high-status neighborhood. So even if you’re\\nearning $100,000 a year, you’re not becoming wealthy. What you probably don’t know is that your\\nneighbor in the $300,000 house next to yours bought his house only after he became wealthy. You\\nbought yours in anticipation of becoming wealthy. That day may never come.\\nEach year you are forced to maximize realized income just to make ends meet. You can’t afford to\\ninvest any money. Essentially, you’re at a stalemate. Your high domestic overhead requires full\\ncommitment of all your income. You will never become financially independent without purchasing\\ninvestments that appreciate without income realization. So what’s it going to be? Will you choose a\\nlifetime of high taxes and high-status living, or will you change your address? Allow us to help you in\\nyour decision making. Here is another one of our rules.\\nIf you’re not yet wealthy but want to be someday, never purchase a home that requires a\\nmortgage that is more than twice your household’s total annual realized income.\\nLiving in less costly areas can enable you to spend less and to invest more of your income. You will\\npay less for your home and correspondingly less for your property taxes. Your neighbors will be less\\nlikely to drive expensive motor vehicles. You will find it easier to keep up, even ahead, of the Joneses\\nand still accumulate wealth.\\nIt’s your choice.

DR. SOUTH', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='nan', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='DOCTORS, PAWS, AND UAWS\\nOn average, physicians earn more than four times the income of the average American household:\\n$140,000 versus $33,000. But Dr. South and Dr. North are hardly average physicians. They are gifted\\nand highly trained specialists. In fact, the average annual income for someone in their specialty is\\nmore than $300,000. But again, they are extraordinary even among their cohorts. Last year they each\\nearned more than $700,000.\\nIn spite of his income, Dr. South has a relatively small level of accumulated wealth. He spends a\\nlot, invests little. Our research has found that physicians in general do not tend to be wealth\\naccumulators. In fact, among all major high-income-producing occupations, physicians have a\\nsignificantly low propensity to accumulate substantial wealth. For every one doctor in the PAW group,\\nthere are two in the UAW category.\\nWhy are doctors lagging behind on the wealth scale? There are several reasons. Foremost among\\nthem is the correlation between wealth and education. This relationship may surprise some people. For\\nall high-income earners (those earning at least $100,000 annually), the relationship between education\\nand wealth accumulation is negative. High-income PAWs are significantly less likely than UAWs to\\nhold graduate degrees, law degrees, or medical degrees. Millionaires typically indicate on our survey\\n“business owner” with “some college,” “four-year college graduate,” or “no college.”\\nWarning: Parents should not suggest that their children drop out of college and start a business .\\nMost businesses fail within a few years of their conception. Only a small minority of business owners\\never earns a six-figure income. But those who do tend to accumulate more wealth than others in the\\nsame income cohort.\\nThe “some college,” “four-year college graduate,” and “no college” types who have high incomes\\noften had a head start on many well-educated workers. Doctors and other well-educated professionals\\nget a very late start in the earnings race. It is difficult to accumulate wealth when one is in school. The\\nlonger one stays in school, the longer one postpones producing an income and building wealth.\\nMost experts on wealth agree that the earlier one starts investing one’s income, the greater the\\nopportunity to accumulate wealth. Mr. Denzi, for example, is a business owner with two years of\\ntechnical school training in data processing. He started working and building wealth at the age of\\ntwenty-two. Today, thirty years later, he has benefited greatly from the meteoric increase in the value\\nof his pension plan.\\nIn sharp contrast, consider the situation of Dr. Dokes, who graduated from high school the same\\nyear as Mr. Denzi. Dr. Dokes opened his private medical practice more than a dozen years after his\\nclassmate, Mr. Denzi, started a business. During that twelve-year period, Dr. Dokes spent his time\\nstudying and spending his savings, his parents’ money, and money he borrowed for tuition and living\\nexpenses. During the same time, Mr. Denzi, who designated himself as “not college material,” focused\\nhis resources on building his business and becoming financially independent.\\nWho is in the UAW category today? Is it the “not-college-material” business owner, Mr. Denzi, or\\nthe valedictorian of his high school class, Dr. Dokes? The answer is obvious. Mr. Denzi is a\\nprototypical PAW, while Dr. Dokes is a UAW. Interestingly, both earned approximately the same\\nincome last year (nearly $160,000). But Mr. Denzi has five to six times the wealth of his high school\\nclassmate. And he has no debt.\\nMr. Denzi can teach us all something about accumulating wealth. Begin earning and investing early\\nin your adult life. That will enable you to outpace the wealth accumulation levels of even the so-called\\ngifted kids from your high school class. Remember, wealth is blind. It cares not if its patrons are well\\neducated. So the authors have an excuse. How else does one explain why two experts on wealth are not', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='wealthy? In part, because they spent a combined total of nearly twenty years pursuing higher\\neducation!\\nAnother reason very well-educated people tend to lag behind on the wealth scale has to do with the\\nstatus ascribed to them by society. Doctors, as well as others with advanced degrees, are expected to\\nplay their parts. Mr. Denzi is a small business owner. In spite of being wealthy, he is not expected by\\nsociety to live in an exclusive neighborhood. He would not be out of place living in a modest home or\\ndriving a nondescript sedan. His domestic overhead is significantly lower than Dr. Dokes’s.\\nMany people tell us that you can judge a book by its cover, meaning that high-grade doctors,\\nlawyers, accountants, and so on are expected to live in expensive homes. They also are expected to\\ndress and drivein a style congruent with their ability to perform their professional duties. How do you\\njudge the professionals you patronize? Too many people judge them by display factors. Extra points\\nare given to those who wear expensive clothes, drive luxury automobiles, and live in exclusive\\nneighborhoods. They assume a professional is likely to be mediocre, even incompetent, if he lives in a\\nmodest home and drives a three-year-old Ford Crown Victoria. Very, very few people judge the\\nquality of the professionals they use by net worth criteria. Many professionals have told us that they\\nmust look successful to convince their customers/clients that they are.\\nOf course, there are exceptions. But people who spend many years in college, professional school,\\nor graduate school are more likely to have higher levels of household overhead than less educated\\npeople. As a rule, doctors have exceptionally high levels of domestic overhead. The concern in many\\nof these households is with consuming, not investing.\\nPhysicians often find that there are disadvantages to living in affluent neighborhoods. People who\\nlive in expensive areas are often bombarded with solicitations from “cold-calling” investment experts.\\nMany of these callers assume that people in upscale areas have money to invest. In reality, many\\npeople who live in luxury have little money left over after funding their high-consumption lifestyles.\\nSome naive cold callers purchase prospect lists that fit two criteria. First, prospects must be\\nphysicians. Second, they must live in exclusive neighborhoods. It’s no wonder physicians are the\\nfavorite targets of some of America’s most aggressive sellers of investment ideas. Too often doctors\\nwho receive such solicitations assume that the callers are “just as professional as physicians.” Many\\nphysicians have told us that they have had bad experiences with investing via cold callers. In fact,\\nmany have been burned so badly that they never again invested in the stock market. This is\\nunfortunate given the overall growth in the real value of the equity market. And, in rejecting the stock\\nmarket, they figured that left them with more money for spending. This attitude is not as rare as one\\nmight think:\\nA plastic surgeon added that he had three boats and five cars but hadn’t gotten around\\nto assembling a pension plan. Financial investments? Didn’t have those, either. Speaking\\nofhis colleagues, the surgeon said, “I don’t know even one guy who hasn’t been beaten to\\ndeath in the financial markets. As a result, they don’t have anything. At least I’m going to\\nenjoy spending my money.”\\nLater on, this doctor summed up his financial philosophy: “Money,” he said, with a\\nwave of his hand, “is the most easily renewable resource” (Thomas J. Stanley, “Why You’re\\nNot As Wealthy As You Should Be,” Medical Economics, July 1992).\\nWhat other factors explain why so many doctors are members of the UAW group? Our research\\nshows that they are generally unselfish. On average, they contribute a higher percentage of their', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='incomes to noble causes than do other high-income producers. Also, doctors are among the least likely\\nto receive inheritances from their parents. Their less-educated brothers and sisters are significantly\\nmore likely to inherit money. In some cases, physicians are asked by their elderly parents to “help out\\n[their] less fortunate brothers and sisters after [the parents] are no longer able to help pay their bills.”\\nThese findings are detailed in Chapter 6.\\nDoctors often allocate large amounts of their time to serving patients. They rarely work fewer than\\nten hours a day, thus expending most of their time, energy, and intellect on patients. In so doing, they\\ntend to neglect their economic well-being. Some doctors figure that working hard translates into a\\nlarge income and that, therefore, there is no need to design a household budget. Some ask why they\\nshould waste time planning a domestic budget and investments when there is so much income to be\\nmade. Many high-income-producing UAWs feel this way.\\nPAWs tend to have just the opposite feelings. To them, money is a resource that should never be\\nsquandered. They know that planning, budgeting, and being frugal are essential parts of building\\nwealth, even for very high-income producers. Even high-income producers must live below their\\nmeans if they intend to become financially independent. And if you’re not financially independent,\\nyou will spend an increasing amount of your time and energy worrying about your socioeconomic\\nfuture.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='PLANNING AND CONTROLLING\\nPlanning and controlling consumption are key factors underlying wealth accumulation. Thus, one\\nshould expect that PAWs like Dr. North take the time to plan their budgets. They do. Conversely, Dr.\\nSouth has no control over his family’s consumption, other than his household’s income limit. We\\nasked Drs. South and North about their respective planning and controlling systems.\\nQuestion: Does your household operate on a fairly well-thought-out annual budget?\\nDr. South: No.\\nDr. North: Yes … absolutely!\\nOperating a household without a budget is akin to operating a business without a plan, without\\ngoals, and without direction. The Norths have a budget that calls for them to invest at least one-third\\nof their pretax household income each year. In fact, during the year that we interviewed Dr. North, he\\nand his wife invested nearly 40 percent of their annual pretax income. How were they able to do this?\\nIn short, they consume at the same level as the average family that earns about one-third as much as\\nthey do.\\nWhat about the Souths? They consume at the same level as the average household that earns nearly\\ntwo times more than they do. In fact, their hyperuse of credit is more in line with that of households\\nthat earn several million dollars each year. The Souths essentially spend all of or more than their\\nincome each year. This income is their only restraint.\\nWe asked both doctors another set of questions:\\n1. Do you know how much your family spends each year for food, clothing, and shelter?\\n2. Do you spend a lot of time planning your financial future?\\n3. Are you frugal?\\nYou probably predicted the outcome. Dr. South responded with three noes, while Dr. North\\nresponded in true PAW fashion, with three yeses. Consider the frugal orientation of Dr. North. He\\nstated emphatically, for instance, that he never bought a suit that was not offered at a discount or a\\nspecial price. This is not to suggest that Dr. North is poorly dressed. Nor does he wear cheap suits.\\nRather, he purchases quality clothing, but not at full price and never on impulse. This behavior was\\npart of his socialization process as a youth:\\nWhen I was going to school, my wife taught. We had a small income…. Even then we\\nalways had a rule … to save—even then we saved. You can’t invest without something…. The\\nfirst thing is to save.\\nEven when I was eleven years old, I saved my first $50 from working in a grocery store.\\nIt’s just like today … only today the number of zeros change…. More zeros, but it’s the same\\nrule, same discipline.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='You must take advantage of investment opportunities…. You have to have something to\\ntake advantage of excellent opportunities…. It’s part of my background.\\nDr. South reported having just the opposite orientation. How much did he and his family spend on\\nclothing during the year prior to our interview? About $30,000 (see Table 3-2). Thus, the Souths spend\\nnearly as much on clothing each year as the average American household earns in total—that is,\\n$33,000.\\nTABLE 3-2\\nCONSUMPTION HABITS: THE NORTHS VS.

Both the South and\\nNorth households are traditional. We determined long ago that the habits of both husband and wife\\naccount for variations in accumulating wealth. Your spouse’s orientation toward thrift, consumption,\\nand investing is a significant factor in understanding your household’s position on the wealth scale.\\nWho is the tightwad in your household? In the case of Dr. North’s family, both he and his wife fit\\nthe profile. Both live well below their means. Both contribute to planning their well-thought-out\\nannual budget. Neither objects to buying used motor vehicles. Both can tell you how much their\\nfamily spends each year for a variety of products and services. Neither objected to sending their\\nchildren to public elementary and high schools. Both place a high priority on being financially\\nindependent. Yet these goals never translated into shortchanging their three children. The parents\\nfunded their children’s college educations as well as their graduate school and law school tuition and\\nfees. They also provided them with funds to purchase homes and for related expenditures. The Norths\\npaid for these expenditures out of investments that they set aside for their children. Conversely, the\\nSouths are not investors. Almost all such allocations in the South household come from current earned\\nincome.\\nWhat if your household generates even a moderately high income and both you and your spouse are\\nfrugal?

On the other hand, it is', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='very difficult for a married couple to accumulate wealth if one is a spendthrift. A household divided in\\nits financial orientation is unlikely to accumulate significant wealth.\\nEven worse are cases in which both the wife and her husband are spendthrifts. This is the domestic\\nsituation the Souths find themselves in today. Interestingly, Dr. South reported to us that he is the\\n“tightwad” in his household. Is he? True, he takes aim at the shopping and consumption habits of his\\nspouse. But spending all or even most of their annual income takes a team effort. Both are\\nhyperconsumers.

But he is also responsible, in part, for making\\nother decisions for his household. He buys the motor vehicles and financial advice. He also makes\\ninvestment decisions. But neither he nor his wife does any budgeting for the family.\\nMrs. South is responsible for buying the family’s clothing. In one year she spent about $30,000 on\\nclothes for herself and her family. She also contributed significantly to the decision to spend more\\nthan $40,000 for country club fees and related expenses. Both decided to spend $107,000 per year in\\nmortgage payments. Most UAWs will tell you that their big mortgage helps reduce their taxable\\nincome. Of course, if the Souths keep saving money this way, they may never be able to retire.\\nOften people who purchase expensive homes and automobiles are criticized for their extravagant\\nlifestyle. But at least homes, in most cases, hold their value, if only in a nominal sense. Even\\nautomobiles hold some value for a few years after they are purchased. Large allocations for homes and\\nautomobiles can have a dampening effect on wealth building, but again, at least you can trade up, out,\\nor down with such items. There are worse culprits.\\nHow much is the Souths’ $30,000 clothing purchase that they made last year worth today? How\\nmuch will the $7,000 vacation they recently took be worth tomorrow? How much value is there\\nremaining from the more than $40,000 they spent last year for country club-related expenses? Add to\\nthese gourmet restaurant patronage, maid services, tutors, lawn care/landscaping services, decorating\\nconsultants, insurance, and more.\\nThe Souths’ consumption habits are related to the fact that they have no centralized control over\\ntheir expenditures. Much of their consumption is a function of independent action in this household\\ndrama. This is not the case in the North household. Dr. North and his wife both play active roles in\\nbudgeting and spending. They plan together and consult with each other regarding expenditures. We\\nwill detail their system. But first let us examine the Souths’ situation.\\nMrs. South is responsible for purchasing a wide variety of products and services for her household.\\nShe did not consult with anyone before spending $30,000 for clothing last year. She does her thing,\\nand her husband does his. She has her set of credit cards, and he has his.\\nMrs. South is a particularly ardent patron of upscale department stores. These include Neiman\\nMarcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Lord & Taylor. She carries credit cards for each of these stores. In\\naddition, she and her husband hold a MasterCard (gold) and a Visa (preferred) card. Dr. South also has\\nthe American Express platinum card.\\nWhat’s the problem? Often Dr. and Mrs. South have little or no idea what their counterpart is\\nbuying or how much each is spending. This is especially true for soft goods and intangibles, such as\\nclothes, gifts, and entertaining. Both are susceptible to solicitations from everyone from store clerks\\nto financial advisors, from automobile sales personnel to credit officers at banks. If you were one of\\nthese people, who would you call? Who would you keep abreast of new product and service offerings?\\nWho would you advise about a special showing of the latest fashions and motor vehicles?\\nWhy does Mrs. South spend so much money? In classic UAW fashion, her husband has encouraged\\nher to do so. He was the product of a high-income-producing, indulgent set of parents. He, in turn, has', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='given his wife almost a blank check when it comes to shopping. And, of course, the Souths associate\\nwith other hyperconsumers. But there is something she and her husband don’t know. They are unique.\\nThey are not typical consumers. No one ever told them that most people in their income bracket,\\nincluding the Norths, never spend money like the Souths do. Unfortunately, the Souths never learned\\nabout thè prodigious accumulators of wealth.\\nThe Norths are very different from the Souths in their spending behavior. Both Dr. and Mrs. North\\ncome from backgrounds of frugality and thrift. Throughout their marriage they have communicated\\nwith each other about resource allocations. Their budgeting system is basic to their controlled-\\nconsumption lifestyle. Unlike the Souths, the Norths own no credit cards for upscale department\\nstores. That’s right. The North family, whose net worth is more than eighteen times that of the Souths\\n($7,500,000 versus $400,000), holds no cards from Neiman Marcus or from Saks Fifth Avenue or\\nfrom Lord & Taylor. They are only “special-occasion” shoppers at such stores. Almost all of their\\nhousehold purchases are placed on one “central” credit card, a Visa (preferred) card. Both their\\npurchases are listed on one single statement each month. Each month theydetermine how much\\nremains to be allocated for each consumption category, and at the end of each year they refer to these\\nstatements to compute their total expenditures for each category. Using this statement facilitates\\nbudgeting and making appropriations for the following year. Most important, their planning,\\nbudgeting, and consuming are coordinated events. Unlike the Souths, the Norths have one joint\\nchecking account to help facilitate the budgeting of items not paid for with their credit card.\\nWhat if you want to budget but don’t like the process? We recently interviewed a CPA who offers a\\nhousehold budgeting and consumption planning service. Mr. Arthur Gifford has several hundred high-\\nincome-producing clients. Most are either self-employed professionals or business owners. Some are\\nPAWs. Some are UAWs.\\nWe asked Mr. Gifford who uses his budgeting and consumption planning system. His response was\\npredictable in light of the case studies of the Souths and Norths:\\nOnly those clients with considerable wealth want to know exactly how much their family\\nspends on each and every category.\\nMr. Gifford is correct. But aren’t PAWs usually price sensitive when it comes to purchasing\\nservices? Not always. They are much less price sensitive when buying services that will help them\\ncontrol their family’s consumption behavior.\\nDo you know exactly how much your family spent last year for each and every category of product\\nand service? Without such knowledge, it’s difficult to control your spending. If you can’t control your\\nspending, you’re unlikely to accumulate prodigious amounts of wealth. A good start is to keep an\\naccurate record of each and every expenditure that your family makes each month. Or ask your\\naccountant to help you set up a system for tabulating and categorizing these expenditures. Then work\\nwith her to develop a budget. The goal is to enable you to set aside for investing purposes at least 15\\npercent of your pretax income each year. By the way, this “15 percent method” is Mr. Gif-ford’s\\nsimple strategy for becoming affluent.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='CAR-SHOPPING METHODS\\nThe Souths outpace the Norths in several consumption categories. During the year prior to our\\ninterview, they allocated six times more money for motor vehicles than the Norths ($72,200 versus\\n$12,000). Dr. South also purchased a $65,000 Porsche during the year of our interview. Dr. South is, in\\nfact, a true connoisseur of fine motor vehicles. He spends little time preparing a budget for his\\nhousehold and even less time planning his financial future. But he has a very different orientation\\nwhen it comes to purchasing automobiles.\\nThere is an inverse relationship between the time spent purchasing luxury items such as\\ncars and clothes and the time spent planning one’s financial future.\\nHigh-income-producing UAWs like Dr. South spend a great deal of their incomes on expensive\\nautomobiles and clothing. But it takes more than money to acquire and maintain large inventories of\\nluxury goods. Such purchases have to be planned. It takes time to shop, and it takes time to care for\\nlarge quantities of expensive high-status artifacts. Time, energy, and money are finite resources, even\\namong high-income generators. Our research indicates that even these top earners cannot have their\\ncake and eat it, too. Dr. North and PAWs in general, on the other hand, allocate their spare time to\\nactivities that they hope will enhance their wealth (see Table 3-6 later in chapter). Such activities\\ninclude studying and planning their investment strategies and managing current investments. We will\\nstudy this issue in greater detail later in this chapter.\\nConversely, UAWs such as Dr. South work hard to maintain and enhance their high standard of\\nliving. Often these high-income-producing UAWs, Dr. South included, outspend their six-figure\\nincomes. So how do they balance their need to maintain their high standard of living with a finite\\nincome? Many aggressively shop for bargains.\\nTHE SOUTH METHOD\\nExamine the activities that Dr. South undertakes prior to purchasing an automobile. You might get the\\nimpression that he is a tightwad. Most UAWs like Dr. South bolster their hyperconsumption behavior\\nby telling would-be critics that everything they buy is purchased near cost, at cost, below cost, and so\\non. It is true that Dr. South is an aggressive bargain shopper. But he just paid more than $65,000 for an\\nexotic sports car. Is this really a bargain? Dr. South made this purchase at “near dealer’s cost.” But\\nwhat were the costs of this so-called deal in time and effort? Most high-income generators, whether\\nthey are PAWs or UAWs, work more than forty hours a week. Typically, the amount of time\\nremaining each week is allocated in ways that are congruent with their goals.\\nAll too often high-income-producing UAWs spend countless hours studying the market—but not\\nthe stock market. They can tell you the names of the top auto dealers, but not the top investment\\nadvisors. They can tell you how to shop and spend. But they can’t tell you how to invest. They know\\nthe styles, prices, and availability at various car dealers. But they know little or nothing about the\\nvarious values of equity market offerings.\\nAs an example, contrast Dr. South’s most recent automobile-shopping activities with that of typical', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='millionaires. On average, the American millionaire employs four to five simple bargain-shopping\\ntechniques when buying a motor vehicle. Dr. South does it differently. He uses at least nine\\nbargaining/shopping tactics and strategies when negotiating with dealers.\\nConsider the level of car-purchasing knowledge Dr. South has recently acquired that will never pay\\ncapital gains or real dividends or enhance the productivity of his business. He now has knowledge\\nabout every Porsche dealer within a four hundred-mile radius of his home. Dr. South also can tell you\\nimmediately the dealer’s cost on nearly every Porsche model, the cost of options and accessories, and\\nthe performance characteristics of most models. It takes much time and effort to acquire such\\ninformation.\\nDr. South has an interesting style when purchasing automobiles. He first decides on the make and\\nmodel of the vehicle he wants and the corresponding accessories. Then he goes all-out into\\ninformation seeking and negotiating. It is not unusual for him to shop around for months “for the very\\nbest deal.” In the process he usually discovers the dealer’s cost on the vehicle. This is done prior to\\nentering into serious negotiations with a dealer. Then he telephones all the dealers (hislong list) and\\ninvites them to compete for his business. He has no problem buying a Porsche from a low-price-\\noriented, out-of-town dealer. Those dealers who designate themselves as price-oriented are then\\nplaced on Dr. South’s short list. The others are dropped from consideration.\\nDealers on his short list are contacted once again. During this stage of the process, Dr. South\\nquizzes the dealers about their willingness to sell at below cost. While doing so, he reminds them of\\nthe low prices quoted by other dealers. He also asks about program/off-lease vehicles. But his heart is\\nalways set on a brand new model.\\nAt the end of the month, Dr. South recontacts all the low-price-oriented dealers. Dr. South does this\\nbecause he feels that dealers have “sales quotas and bank notes due” at that time. He invites all these\\ndealers to give their “final lowest bid” for his business. For his most recent purchase, during the last\\nday of the month and after a flurry of phone calls, he finally accepted a bid from an out-of-town\\ndealer.\\nDr. South is penny-wise, pound-foolish when purchasing motor vehicles. But he has convinced\\nhimself that he is a prudent buyer. After all, he spends much time and energy trying to buy cars at or\\nnear dealer cost. But perhaps dealer cost was too high a price to pay. It is difficult to accumulate\\nwealth if you spend much of your time, energy, and money for a so-called dealer cost price on an\\nextremely expensive motor vehicle.\\nConsider this fact: Most millionaires we have interviewed never in their lifetimes spent near\\n$65,000 for an automobile. In fact, as we will report in Chapter 4, more than half the millionaires we\\ninterviewed never paid more than $30,000 for a motor vehicle. Remember, though, Dr. South is not a\\nmillionaire. Certainly in terms of net worth, millionaires are better able to afford a $65,000\\nautomobile. But they ignore such opportunities. As so often is said, “That’s why they’re millionaires!”\\nCertainly the consumption of very expensive automobiles has a dampening effect on the probability\\nthat one will ever accumulate significant wealth. During the year we interviewed him, Dr. South spent\\nmore than $70,000 for his most recent motor vehicle purchase, related sales tax, and insurance. Yet for\\nthe same period, how much did he place in his pension plan? About $5,700! In other words, only about\\n$1 in every $125 of his income was set aside for retirement. Theamount of time Dr. South took to find\\nthe best deal on his car was also counterproductive. We estimated that it took him more than sixty\\nhours to study, negotiate, and purchase his Porsche. How much time and effort does it take someone to\\nplace money in a pension plan? A small fraction of this time and energy. It is easy for Dr. South to say\\nhe wants to accumulate wealth, but his actions speak much louder than his words. Perhaps that\\nexplains why he has lost a considerable amount of wealth through imprudent investing. Investing\\nwhen one has little or no intellectual basis for one’s decisions often translates into major losses.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='THE NORTH METHOD\\nDr. North is not a connoisseur of motor vehicles, although he is price-sensitive when making\\npurchasing decisions. We asked Dr. North about his most recent automobile purchase. Remember that\\nDr. South’s most recent purchase was the current year’s model. Note that fewer than 25 percent of\\nAmerica’s millionaires are driving the current year’s model. And, of course, Dr. South is not a\\nmillionaire.\\nDr. North proudly informed us that he purchased his most recent automobile six years ago. We\\nanticipate your question: Do you mean he has not purchased a new automobile in six years? Not only\\nhas Dr. North not purchased a new automobile in six years, but the one he purchased six years ago was\\na three-year-old Mercedes-Benz 300 that he bought for $35,000.\\nDr. North loves the car: great price, excellent fuel economy—”It’s a diesel.” And, of course, diesel\\nMercedes often can last for hundreds of thousands of miles before they need an overhaul. It also has\\nclassic styling.\\nHow much time and energy did Dr. North expend in purchasing his Mercedes? Let’s examine his\\ndecision-making process. First, he decided that he needed to replace his “old car.” After all, it was\\ntwenty years old. He knew that many European luxury automobiles depreciate rapidly during the first\\nthree years following their initial purchase. So he figured that he might be able to save a considerable\\namount if he purchased a three-year-old Mercedes Benz.\\nHe confirmed this speculation by determining the original retail price of the model he was\\ninterested in purchasing. A quick trip to alocal dealer was all that was required to gain this knowledge.\\nDr. North then decided that his best choice would be a three-year-old model. He telephoned a few\\ndealers and advised them of his interest. He also examined several advertisements in the classified\\nsection of the paper. Finally he decided on a low-mileage model offered by a local dealer. As he\\nexplained:\\nAutomobiles? I have always placed a premium on quality. But I never lease, never\\nfinance. I drive a Mercedes-Benz. Since I started my practice, I have only had two cars. The\\nfirst, a Mercedes, I purchased new just after I opened my practice…. Kept it twenty years.\\nThen I bought my second car … a three-year-old Mercedes. I went to a dealer…. He wanted\\nto sell me a new one. But it was $20,000 more than the used one on the lot.\\nThen I just asked myself a simple question: Is the “pride of new car ownership”—and\\nthat’s all it is, pride—worth $20,000? The cars are the same. The answer is no. The “pride\\nof new car ownership” is not worth $20,000.\\nThe North method took only a few hours. Contrast this with Dr. South’s automobile-purchasing\\ncrusade—a process that took him at least sixty hours. And, of course, Dr. North likes to keep his cars\\nfor a long time. So his allocation of purchasing time is spread over several years. On average, he\\ndevotes less than an hour a year to purchasing motor vehicles. But Dr.. South likes to buy a new car\\nevery year. Thus, his sixty-hour project is typically allocated to only one year.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='FEARS AND WORRIES\\nWhat do you spend time worrying about? Are your concerns congruent with wealth accumulation? Or\\ndo you spend time thinking about issues that are impediments to becoming affluent? How do PAWs\\nand UAWs differ in regard to their fears and concerns? In simple terms, UAWs worry more than\\nPAWs. PAWs and UAWs also worry about different issues. Overall, PAWs have significantly fewer\\nconcerns and fears than their counterparts.\\nWhat if you spend much of your time thinking about a lot of issues that concern you? You will\\nspend less time taking action to solve these problems. And what if your fears provide a foundation for\\nincreased spending? You may be a member of the UAW group.\\nFears and concerns can be both a cause for becoming a UAW as well as a result. Will a person who\\nconstantly worries about earning more money to enhance his lifestyle become wealthy? Probably not.\\nDr. South is not wealthy, in part because he concerns himself with such issues. Dr. North is wealthy\\ntoday because he placed much less priority on standard-of-living issues than did Dr. South.\\nDr. South told us that nineteen issues were of high or moderate concern to him (see Table 3-1). Dr.\\nNorth was concerned with only about seven issues. Thus, it’s only logical to conclude that the Dr.\\nNorths of this country have more time and energy to devote to wealth-enhancing activities. Let’s\\nexamine how these doctors’ fears and worries—or lack of them—have affected their lives.\\nTHE CHILDREN OF UAWs AND PAWs\\nThe Souths have four children. Two are adults. Dr. South has serious, well-founded concerns about\\ntheir future. UAWs tend to produce children who eventually become UAWs themselves. What is\\nexpected of children who are exposed to a household environment predicated upon very high\\nconsumption, few—if any—economic constraints, little planning or budgeting, no discipline, and\\npandering to every product-related desire? Like their UAW parents, as adults, these children are often\\naddicted to an undisciplined, high-consumption lifestyle. Further, these children typically will never\\nearn the incomes necessary to support the lifestyle to which they have grown accustomed.\\nCertainly Dr. South’s parents’ indulgent lifestyle contributed to his becoming a UAW. And he\\nlearned so well. His lifestyle is even more consumption-oriented than that of his mother and father.\\nHis upper-middle-class lifestyle was never interrupted even when he was in graduate school and\\nmedical school. His parents paid for his home and all other expenses. They provided him with\\nsubstantial gifts of cash each year. In essence, he never really had to change his consumption habits or\\nstandard of living after leaving home. Fortunately for him, he has the income to support his addiction\\nto consumption. But what about his children? They have lived in a high-consumption environment that\\nwould be extremely difficult to replicate on their own. The curtain is coming down on the third\\ngeneration. Dr. South indicated in our interviews with us that he believed his children would never\\ngenerate even a fraction of the income he currently earns.\\nIn comparison, Dr. North’s adult children are demonstrating more independence and discipline, in\\npart because they have been exposed to a much more frugal, well-planned, and disciplined lifestyle.\\nAs we noted, the Norths consume at a level that is more congruent with a household earning less than\\none-third of their income. This living below their means is precisely why PAWs throughout the\\nincome spectrum tend to produce children who are economically disciplined and self-sufficient adults.\\nPAWs tend to produce children who become PAWs.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Dr. South, as indicated, has accumulated considerably less wealth than Dr. North. He is\\nsignificantly less able than Dr. North to support the economic outpatient care of his adult children. But\\nironically it is Dr. South who is burdened by having economically dependent adult children.\\nWe questioned both Dr. South and Dr. North about their fears and worries concerning their children.\\nAs you may have already predicted, Dr. South is much more concerned about this issue. He\\nspecifically expressed fears of\\n1. having adult children who think his wealth is their income.\\n2. having to support his adult children financially.\\nImagine how disconcerting it is for someone like Dr. South to face the prospect of supporting his\\nextended family. Chapters 5 and 6 will explore the implications of “economic outpatient care” in great\\ndetail. However, there is an important point to note at this time: Having adult children who are UAWs\\ngreatly reduces the probability that their parents will ever become wealthy!\\nDr. South wonders where his children got the idea that their parents would provide them with\\nsubstantial economic outpatient care. Heworries that he will not have the resources to provide his\\nchildren with all the subsidies his parents gave him. There is yet another fear Dr. South must face. He\\nis becoming more and more worried that his children will not get along with each other. Much of this\\nconcern is rooted in their need for economic support from their parents. Dr. North does not worry\\nabout such issues.\\nWe asked both doctors about these types of concerns. Dr. South worried that\\n1. his family/children will fight over his estate.\\n2. he will be accused of financially favoring one adult child over another.\\nAre Dr. South’s fears justified? Ask yourself this question: What is the greatest fear of the thirty-\\nyear-old sons and daughters of the Dr. Souths of America? That the economic outpatient care they\\nreceive from their parents will stop. Many “thirty-something” UAWs cannot maintain anywhere near\\nthe lifestyle they had while living with Dad and Mom. In fact, many are unable to purchase even a\\nmodest home without financial subsidies from their parents. It is not unusual for these “rich kids” to\\nreceive substantial cash and other financial gifts until they are in their late forties or even early fifties.\\nOften these adult UAWs compete with each other for their parents’ wealth. What would you do if your\\neconomic subsidy was being threatened by the presence of your equally dependent brothers and\\nsisters?\\nDr. South is not only worried about his problems; he is also worried about his children’s problems.\\nConsider for a moment the legacy he is leaving them. What are the ramifications of being an\\neconomically dependent adult? How much insecurity and fear will they have to deal with in the\\nfuture? How will they be able to have harmonious, loving relationships with each other? These are\\namong the issues Dr. South spends more and more time contemplating.\\nDr. North is much less concerned with such problems. His adult children are accustomed to living\\nin a much more frugal and disciplined environment. They are less likely to have a perceived need for\\nmajor doses of economic outpatient care.\\nTAXES, GOVERNMENT, AND GOVERNMENT', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Many high-income earners in America—both PAWs and UAWs—are greatly concerned about the\\nactions of the federal government. These actions are external forces—those over which an individual\\nhas no control. Dr. South indicated that he feared four external forces that are government-related.\\nInterestingly, these issues are not of major concern to Dr. North. Let’s look at these four concerns:\\n1: Paying increasingly high federal income taxes\\nBoth physicians think that the federal government is likely to require high-income producers to pay\\nmore in taxes. But tax increases are more the concern of Dr. South than of Dr. North. Why is Dr. South\\nconcerned about this issue? Because he needs to maximize his realized income to support his\\nhyperconsumption lifestyle. If the government requires Dr. South to pay a higher share of his income,\\nhis lifestyle will be threatened.\\nWhat about Dr. North? He told us that he had a low level of concern over the prospects of the\\nfederal government increasing the share of his realized income that he must pay in taxes. Last year Dr.\\nNorth paid approximately $277,000 in income taxes (see Table 3-3). This may seem like a big bite.\\nBut look at it through the eyes of Dr. North. He looks at income tax more as a portion of his total\\nwealth than a portion of his realized income.\\nWhat if the government doubled the tax rate on high incomes? This is very unlikely, but just as an\\nexample, Dr. North would then have to pay the equivalent of 8 percent of his wealth each year. By\\ncomparison, Dr. South would be at a “wealth rate” of 150 percent! Is it any wonder Dr. North is much\\nless concerned about paying increasingly higher federal income taxes than Dr. South is?\\nTABLE 3-3\\nINCOME AND WEALTH CONTRASTS\\n2: Increased government spending and the federal deficit\\nDr. South is very concerned about this issue. He believes that increased spending on the part of the\\ngovernment will translate into higher taxes on his income. Dr. North is not overly concerned for the\\nreasons stated above.\\n3: A high rate of inflation\\nDr. South is also concerned that such government action as increased spending and an increase in the', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='deficit will precipitate a significant increase in the inflation rate. Dr. South has a moderate level of\\nconcern about this issue because he, like many UAWs, keeps trading up to more and more expensive\\nhomes, cars, clothes, and so on. On the other hand, Dr. North feels that inflation will significantly\\nincrease the value of at least part of his investment portfolio!\\n4: Increased government regulation of business and industry\\nMost physicians feel that this type of government action is targeted at them. They interpret increases\\nin government regulation as preceding the advent of socialized medicine. Both physicians feel that\\nthis would have a dampening effect on the fees they generate for their professional services. Dr. South\\nindicated that this issue is of significant concern to him, while Dr. North viewed such action as only a\\nminor concern.\\nWhy do these two respondents perceive things so differently?\\nThe actions of the government are often a threat to high-income earners who use most of their\\nincomes to support their lifestyles. This is especially true when there is political gain for those in\\npower in targeting the “wealthy.” Actually, the people the politicians are targeting are high-income\\nearners. Most politicians don’t understand the difference between having a high income and having\\nhigh levels of wealth. They have a more difficult time targeting people with high levels of net worth.\\nMost millionaires who are PAWs are self-employed. Being self-employed gives one much more\\ncontrol over one’s economic future than does working for others. Conversely, employees today, even\\nhigh-income-producing executives, have less control over their livelihoods than ever before.\\nDownsizing, for example, is taking its toll, even among the most productive employees. More often\\nthan not, even high-income-producing employees are not likely to be millionaires.\\nUAWs who are employees (not self-employed) are particularly vulnerable to external forces that\\nthreaten their ability to earn a living. We found that only 19 percent of PAWs versus 36 percent of\\nhigh-income-producing nonmillionaires (UAWs) were concerned about having their jobs eliminated\\n(see Table 3-4). But in spite of the “handwriting” that is often “on the wall,” even most high-income-\\nearning employees are consumption-oriented.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='FINANCIAL GOALS: WORDS VERSUS DEEDS\\nMany high-income-producing PAWs and UAWs share similarly stated goals concerning wealth\\naccumulation.

Planning and wealth accumulation are significant correlates even among\\ninvestors with modest incomes. In our survey of 854 middle-income respondents (see Table 3-5), for\\nexample, a strong positive correlation was found between investment planning and wealth\\naccumulation.\\nOne of the more interesting findings in our studies of the affluent relates to why many people spend', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='so little time planning their investments.

In other words, PAWs spend an average of 83 percent more hours (100.8 versus 55.2) planning\\nper month than do UAWs. UAWs allocate only 1 in 160 hours of their total available time to planning\\ntheir investments. PAWs allocate 1 in 87 hours.\\nWill UAWs automatically become PAWS simply by doubling the number of hours they devote to\\nplanning their investments? Not likely. Planning is only one of many key ingredients in building\\nwealth. Most PAWs have a regimented planning schedule. Each week, each month, each year, they\\nplan their investments. They also start planning at a much earlier age than do UAWs.\\nUAWs, on the other hand, are much like some overweight people who occasionally starve\\nthemselves to reach their ideal weight. But more often than not, they regain all the weight they lost\\nand more. UAWs may start the new year with a plan that outlines a variety of investment goals. These\\ngoals may be the product of a couple of days of aggressive planning that specifies the number of\\ndollars allocated to investments. Also included in the plan may be a significant “cold-turkey”\\nreduction in the consumption of goods and services. More often than not, this “shock planning” and\\ncorresponding radical change in lifestyle are so severe that they do not work. The typical UAW, in this\\ncase, quickly becomes disenchanted with his new model for wealth building. Soon he “falls off the\\nwagon,” once again breaking his promise of planning, investing more, and consuming less.\\nMany UAWs think that a professionally prepared plan will make them PAWs overnight, but even\\nthe best financial plans are ineffective if you don’t follow them. All too often UAWs think that others\\n“can lose weight” for them.\\nThe UAWs in such cases would greatly benefit from understanding how PAWs operate. PAWs do a\\nlittle planning each and every month. Again, only about eight hours a month. UAWs might do more\\nplanning if they knew that it would not require them to “quit their day jobs”! PAWs build wealth\\nslowly. They do not live a spartan existence, but they do have a regimen when it comes to balancing\\nworking, planning, investing, and consuming.\\nYOUR TIME IS YOUR OWN\\nThe work factor is an important part of understanding the differences between PAWs and UAWs. Note\\nin our study of middle-income respondents the percentage (59.1 versus 24.7) of PAWs versus UAWs\\nwho are self-employed (see Table 3-5). In this study, self-employment correlated significantly with\\nplanning investments. Overall, the self-employed spend more time planning their investment\\nstrategies than those who work for others. The self-employed, even those with middle incomes,\\ntypically integrate investment planning into their work lives. Most employees, in sharp contrast, have\\na set of job-related tasks that are independent of planning their investment strategies. Why is this so?\\nThose who succeed among the ranks of the self-employed never take their economic position for\\ngranted. Most middle-aged people who are self-employed have seen good as well as bad economic\\ntimes. They tend to offset the inevitable changes in their revenue by planning and investing. They\\nmust build and manage their pension plans by themselves. They have to rely on themselves for their\\ncurrent and future financial situations. More often than not, only the well-disciplined self-employed\\nsurvive economically over the long run.\\nBut, you may ask, don’t these people work long and hard? Yes, most successful people who are self-\\nemployed work ten to fourteen hours per day. In fact, this is why many employees shy away from even\\nconsidering “going out on their own.” They want something less demanding. They want to be', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='employees. But most workers, even those with middle-level incomes, also work long and hard. As for\\nemployees who earn annual incomes in the upper five or lower six digits, much of their time and\\nenergy is allocated to their jobs. They usually don’t have the benefit of writing their own job\\ndescriptions. And their occupational tasks typically don’t include setting aside a few hours per week to\\nplan their investments. In contrast, the self-employed, especially in the high-income category, have a\\ndifferent set of occupational goals; one of them is to become financially independent. Conversely,\\nemployees are too often fully dependent on their employers. Thus they tend to be less self-reliant\\nwhen it comes to planning their investments in a way that will facilitate accumulating wealth.\\nThere is another issue to consider in the planning equation: UAWs spend less time planning their\\ninvestments than do PAWs, in part because of the nature of their investments. UAWs consider\\ncash/near cash and equivalents, such as savings accounts, money market funds, and short-term\\ntreasury bills, to be investments. UAWs are nearly twice as likely as PAWs to hold at least 20 percent\\nof their total wealth in cash/near cash. Most of these cash categories are federally insured. Most are\\neasily accessed when consumption needs arise. And, of course, it takes less time to plan cash-related\\ninvestments than it does to allocate wealth the way PAWs tend to do.\\nPAWs are more likely to invest in categories that usually appreciate in value but do not produce\\nrealized income. They tend to have a greater percentage of their wealth invested in privately\\nheld/closelyheld businesses, commercial real estate, publicly traded equities, and their pension\\nplans/annuities and other tax-deferred categories. These types of investments require planning. They\\nare also the foundation for wealth. UAWs hold a larger percentage of their wealth in motor vehicles\\nand other assets that tend to depreciate.\\nACTIVE OR INACTIVE TRADER?\\nNearly all (95 percent) of the millionaires we surveyed own stocks; most have 20 percent or more of\\ntheir wealth in publicly traded stocks. Yet you would be wrong to assume that these millionaires\\nactively trade their stocks. Most don’t follow the ups and downs of the market day by day. Most don’t\\ncall their stock brokers each morning to ask how the London market did. Most don’t trade stocks in\\nresponse to daily headlines in the financial media.\\nDo you define active investors as people who, on average, keep an investment for days? Of the\\nmillionaires we interviewed, fewer than 1 percent of those who own stock are in this league. How\\nabout weeks? Another 1 percent. Let’s move up to those who, on average, hold on for months but less\\nthan a year. Fewer than 7 percent are “monthly” investors. Overall, only about 9 percent of the\\nmillionaires we have interviewed hold their investments for less than one year. In other words, fewer\\nthan one in ten millionaires are “active investors.” One in five (20 percent) hold, on average, for a\\nyear or two; one in four (25 percent) hold for between two and four years. About 13 percent are in the\\nfour-to-six-year category. More than three in ten (32 percent) hold their investments for more than six\\nyears. In fact, 42 percent of the millionaires we interviewed for our latest survey had made no trades\\nwhatsoever in their stock portfolios in the year prior to the interview.\\nThe so-called active investor is one of the more difficult types of millionaires to find for interview\\npurposes. He may be an ideal target market for stock brokers. He certainly spends considerable\\namounts for brokerage fees related to his trading. But he represents a very small minority of the\\nmillionaire population. In fact, we have encountered more nonmillionaire active traders than\\nmillionaires who actively trade. How can this be possible? Because it is very expensive to buy and\\nsell, buy and sell, buy and sell one’s equity holdings each day or week or month.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Often, active investors spend more time trading than studying and planning their investments.\\nConversely, millionaires spend more time studying far fewer offerings. Thus, they can focus their\\ntime and energy—the resources needed to master their understanding of a much smaller variety of\\nofferings in the market.\\nWe have always been interested in studying the wealth accumulation habits of stock brokers.\\nCompared with the members of other industries, stock brokers earn high incomes. They have access to\\nlarge amounts of research data. Also, they pay less than other people when they trade securities\\nbecause they earn their own commissions. Are all these high-income-producing investment advisors\\nwealthy? Not by a long shot.\\nWe have asked many stock brokers about this issue. Perhaps one individual stock broker stated it\\nbest when he told us:\\nI’d be rich if I would just keep … [my stocks, but I] can’t help but make trades in my own\\nportfolio. I’m looking at the screen every day.\\nKeep in mind that this broker’s net annual income is in excess of $200,000. But because he’s a very\\nactive investor, he rarely allows the investment seeds he sows to grow. Any short-term realized gains\\nhe enjoys are taxed immediately. He is not the type of broker a millionaire prefers to patronize. Then\\nwhat type do they prefer? Far less active investors. They prefer to deal with those who believe in\\nbuying based on considerable studying and then holding.\\nLet’s return to our case studies, Drs. North and South, to see financial planning in action.\\nCOMPARING TIMES\\nDr. North allocates about ten hours in a typical month, or 120 hours a year, to studying and planning\\nhis future investment decisions (see Table 3-6). In contrast, Dr. South allocates three hours a month,\\nor fewer than forty hours a year.\\nTABLE 3-6\\nHOURS ALLOCATED: DR. NORTH VS. DR. SOUTH CONTRASTED WITH SAMPLES OF\\nPAWS AND UAWS\\nWho spends more time managing his current investments? Again, the answer is predictable. Dr.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='North, on average, allocates about twenty hours a month, or 240 hours in a typical year, for this\\npurpose, while his counterpart reported spending only one hour per month managing his current\\ninvestments. Certainly, this is a contributing factor to Dr. South’s low net worth.\\nDr. North is a focused investor. He has two favorite investment categories, agricultural land and\\nstocks from the medical industry:\\nFirst, a fellow I attended medical school with … He saved the life of a patient who\\nbelieved in investing in grade A agriculture/orchards. My colleague invested and told me\\nabout it. He told me that these people were very honest. I met them and agreed. I have been\\ninvesting ever since … still investing regularly today.\\nI have made most in the stock market from the medical industry…. Drug companies and\\nmedical instrument companies … I know this area. I do research on the medical… drug\\nfield…. That’s what Warren Buffett does … invests in companies that he knows and\\nunderstands. But you must have seed money [savings to invest] in areas you have knowledge.\\nI have over $2 million in my profit-sharing plan.\\nDr. South is responsible for making the major investment decisions in his family. It was his\\ndecision to have accounts at four different full-service brokerage firms. But surprisingly, Dr. South\\nhas less than $200,000 in securities. Then why does he have four different financial advisors? Because\\nhe believes, incorrectly, that he does not need to spend time making his own investment decisions. He\\nadmitted to us that he would be “really” affluent if he did not take advice from these so-called experts.\\nBut even bad advice does not come cheap. We estimated that Dr. South spent over $35,000 in a single\\nyear for advice and trades related to his poorly performing $200,000 portfolio. What about Dr. North?\\nDuring the same period he spent zero dollars for transaction fees and zero dollars for financial advice.\\nHe is his own financial advisor. He rarely sells stocks. Also, there are no transaction fees for his direct\\ninvesting in farmland and its products.\\nDr. South, in traditional UAW fashion, has been burned by financial advisors. Too often people in\\nhis position respond to cold calls from brokers who are touting the stock of the week. Too often Dr.\\nSouth is late entering the up market and exits it too early. In sharp contrast, most of the PAWs we\\nhave interviewed make their own investment decisions. They take the time and energy to study\\ninvestment opportunities. They consult with financial advisors, but ultimately their investment\\ndecisions are their own.\\nDr. South has a history of trading rapidly among his brokers’ “flavors of the month.” He spends\\nmany dollars for these trades. If these “flavors” appreciate in value, they precipitate capital gains\\ntaxes. On the other hand, when stocks in a pension plan are traded, they are not subject to capital gains\\ntaxes. Unfortunately, Dr. South is not a big fan of pension plans. We estimated that he had less than\\n$40,000 in his plan at the time of our interview with him!\\nWHO ARE YOUR SUPPLIERS?\\nHow did you hire your household’s financial advisor? Did you list the position in the help-wanted\\nsection of your local newspaper? Did you evaluate the stacks of resumes your advertisement\\ngenerated? Or did you ask your accountant, attorney, or minister to help you find a quality advisor?', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Many people tell us that such methods are just too much work.\\nThis is unfortunate. The more intellect, time, and energy you spend in hiring a financial advisor, the\\nmore likely you will be to find a suitable one. Perhaps you’re not convinced about the need to exert\\nyourself in this task. Look at it another way.\\nHow much time and effort did it take you to find your most recent employment position? What are\\nthe chances that you could call General Motors, IBM, or Microsoft and obtain a job today by phone?\\nWhat theme would you use?\\nHi, I’m a red-hot potential employee. I can greatly enhance the productivity of any\\ndepartment in which I’m placed. I’m smart, efficient, positive, personable, well groomed,\\nresourceful, and have empathy for the needs of others. When do you want me to start?\\nYour chances of being hired by placing a telephone call, especially a cold call, are near zero. Then\\nwhy do so many people hire their financial advisor after he or she made a cold call to them? Because\\nthey are not experienced in hiring employees.\\nWhy aren’t you as wealthy as you should be? It may be because of the way you operate your\\nhousehold. Would a business, especially a very productive one, ever hire a key employee without\\ndoing a serious background check and an in-depth interview? No! Yet most people, even those with\\nhigh incomes, hire financial advisors after obtaining little or no background information about these\\n“employment candidates.”\\nSome high-income people have responded to our views on this topic by stating: “But I’m not hiring\\nan employee—I’m just doing some investing with the fellow who called on me.” Our response to such\\nstatements is simple: Operate your household like a productive business. The best businesses hire the\\nbest people. They also patronize the best suppliers. Utilizing the best human resources and top\\nsuppliers are two major reasons the most productive organizations succeed while others fail. You\\nshould view all financial advisors who solicit you as a client merely as applicants. View them as\\nprospective employees or suppliers for your household. Then ask yourself some simple questions:\\nWhat criteria would a productive personnel manager use in evaluating each of these applicants?\\nWould a skilled purchasing agent and/or a chief financial officer of an organization buy investment\\ninformation and products from this potential supplier? What criteria, what key pieces of background\\ninformation, would be used to evaluate potential suppliers?\\nBefore a well-run business would ever hire a financial advisor or a supplier of investment intellect,\\nit would insist on many vital pieces of hard copy, including the following:\\n♦ Several references\\n♦ An official college transcript\\n♦ A credit check\\n♦ A series of personal interviews\\n♦ Completion of a detailed employment application\\n♦ Documents attesting to the ability of the applicant to perform the duties and tasks required', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Your ability to hire high-grade financial advisors is directly related to your propensity to\\naccumulate wealth. This, in turn, relates to one of the fundamental reasons business owners outpace\\nall other occupational categories in accumulating wealth. Most high-income business owners have\\nmore experience in evaluating potential suppliers, employee applicants, and human resources in\\ngeneral than do individuals in other occupational groups. Being in business requires the constant\\nevaluation of such resources.\\nTHE MARTIN METHOD\\nSeveral years ago we had the pleasure of interviewing Mr. Martin, a very astute investor and a self-\\nmade millionaire. Mr. Martin participated in a focus group interview we conducted with eight\\nmultimillionaires. To be included in the group, respondents had to have a net worth of $5 million or\\nmore. Building a net worth of $5 million or more in one generation is quite an accomplishment. But\\nMr. Martin is rare even within this category, since he never had an earned annualincome (from\\nemployment) of more than $75,000! How did Mr. Martin become so wealthy? He is one of the best\\ninvestors we have ever interviewed. Mr. Martin made his fortune via the stock market. We found him\\nto be extremely bright and well informed about various investments. He is also an excellent judge of\\ninvestment advisors.\\nAs you may expect, Mr. Martin subscribes to a wide variety of investment-related publications.\\nSeveral of these sell their mailing lists to brokers. Thousands of financial advisors have access to Mr.\\nMartin’s address and telephone number. Mr. Martin estimates that each week at least three or four\\nbrokers attempt to solicit his investment dollars via cold calls. How does Mr. Martin deal with these\\ncallers? He instructs his secretary to follow the “Martin Method,” which is used to debrief all callers.\\nWhat is the “Martin Method”? Here is what he told us during the interview:\\nI am a businessman who goes out and tests people. Brokers call me a lot. They say, “I\\nhave a great deal of experience in Wall Street’s best offerings…. I have a fantastic track\\nrecord of making money for my clients.”\\nI always say: “Do you have some good investment ideas for me—really good?” He\\nsays, “Absolutely, especially if you’re willing to make trades in your portfolio. I only handle\\naccounts with a minimum of $200,000.”\\nThen I tell him, “So you’re really good. Well, I’ll tell you what. Send me a copy of your\\npersonal income tax returns from the last few years and a list of what you have had in your\\nown portfolio for the past three years. If you made more money than I did from investments,\\nI’ll invest with you. Here’s my address.”\\nWhen they say, “We can’t show that to you,” I tell them, “You are likely to be full of\\nbaloney.” This is my strategy for checking people out. It works. I check them all out this\\nway. I mean it very honestly.\\nPerhaps you’re asking yourself how Mr. Martin finds time to evaluate all those stacks of credentials\\nhe receives from cold callers. During the many years Mr. Martin has been an active investor, he has\\nreceived countless telephone solicitations. How many of these solicitors “applied for the job” as\\nfinancial advisor to the Martin household by submitting their credentials? Zero! Not one of the dozens', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='of cold callers submitted his income and wealth appreciation data to Mr. Martin.\\nAccording to Mr. Martin, “If these guys were really good, they would not spend all their time\\ncalling me.” Well, fair enough, Mr. Martin. But not everyone in America has your investment\\nintellect, income, and net worth. Many people would be better off financially if they used the services\\nof a financial advisor, even one who cold called them, for the simple reason that most financial\\nadvisors are significantly more knowledgeable about investing than the average high-income UAW.\\nHow one comes into contact with one’s financial advisor is a correlate of wealth appreciation. How\\ndid Mr. Martin come into contact with his? Like the majority of PAWs, he used interpersonal\\ncommunication. Early in his career he asked his accountant for a referral to a quality financial advisor.\\nThe accountant provided the names of several such advisors. Mr. Martin also asked for referrals from\\nthose of the accountant’s clients whose investments always seemed to do well. Mr. Martin has\\npatronized several financial advisors since first being introduced via his accountant. He also relies on\\nothers for investment advice, including his attorney and CPA.\\nMr. Martin always felt his financial advisors were credible sources of investment wisdom because\\nall were endorsed by his CPA and/or his CPA’s most successful investors. Also, Mr. Martin reasoned\\nquite correctly that these financial advisors would treat him as a special client. And, indeed, they went\\nout of their way to provide him with good advice and timely forecasts. Why? To do otherwise would\\njeopardize their relationships with their referral network. What would Mr. Martin do if his advisors\\nprovided him with poor service and low-quality advice? He would complain to the CPA who endorsed\\nthese people. The CPA would not enjoy losing Mr. Martin as a client and would likely cast these\\nadvisors out of his referral network. No financial advisor would enjoy being fired in this way. Even\\nbetter-grade advisors seem to turn up their level of service for members of important referral\\nnetworks.\\nWhat is to be learned from this case scenario? Choose a financial advisor who is endorsed by an\\nenlightened accountant and/or his clients with investment portfolios that in the long run outpace the\\nmarket. If you don’t have an accountant, hire one.\\nAnother correlate of wealth accumulation is employment of a CPA, not just to do taxes but also to\\nprovide various kinds of investment advice. To find a high-quality accountant, ask friends or\\nassociates who fit the PAW profile. You may wish to call the accounting department at your state’s\\nuniversity. Speak with several accounting faculty. Ask them for the names of their former students\\nwho have established track records in helping clients make enlightened financial decisions. Another\\nmethod is to call the local offices of national accounting firms, which are often very selective in their\\nhiring. Even large firms have many smaller accounting/financial planning clients. We selected our\\nCPAs based on two criteria. First, the CPAs were recommended by professors of accounting. Second,\\nthe CPAs were initially hired out of college by major accounting firms and later started their own\\nsuccessful accounting firms. We find that many of the very best CPAs and financial planners follow\\nthis career path.\\nSome CPAs are better than others at helping clients accumulate wealth. Interview several. Choose\\nthe one who has the highest concentration of PAWs as clients.

W. W. Allan is a self-made multimillionaire. He and his wife have lived in the same three-\\nbedroom house in the same middle-class neighborhood for nearly forty years.

He will tell you that he never burdened himself with status\\nvehicles or products of any kind. Mr. Allan’s businesses, as well as his household, are highly efficient\\noperations. The productivity of his businesses, coupled with his household’s moderate consumption\\nhabits, produced many surplus dollars. These, in turn, were reinvested in his businesses, commercial\\nreal estate, and the common stocks of a variety of high-quality American corporations. Mr. Allan is\\nwhat we call a super-PAW.

But ask them why they work\\nso hard, why they selected the careers they did, and their answers are much different from Mr. Allan’s.\\nThey are UAWs, and UAWs, especially high-income producers, work to spend, not to achieve or\\nbecome financially independent.

The average buyer of a motor vehicle in America has a net worth that is less\\nthan 2 percent of that of these millionaires. Do they buy motor vehicles that cost 2 percent of what\\nmillionaires pay? If they did, they would spend, on average, about $580 (2 percent of $29,000).\\nInstead, typical motor vehicle buyers spend the equivalent of at least 30 percent of their net worth for\\nsuch purchases. Note also that, on average, American consumers buy new motor vehicles at a price\\nthat is 72 percent of the most that a typical millionaire ever spent on a motor vehicle. Does this give\\nyou some idea of why so few Americans are millionaires?\\nThose millionaires who lease vehicles are a minority—fewer than 20 percent. What was the “price”\\nof their most recent acquisition/lease? We estimate that 50 percent leased vehicles that were priced at\\n$31,680 or less. About 80 percent leased vehicles valued at or under $44,500. People often ask us,\\n“Should I lease?” Our answer is always the same:\\nMore than 80 percent of millionaires purchase their vehicles.

U.S. car manufacturers may be pleased to note\\nthat their makes account for 57.7 percent of the vehicles millionaires are driving; Japanese makes\\naccount for 23.5 percent, while European manufacturers hold 18.8 percent. What makes of cars are\\nmost popular with millionaires? The following are listed in rank order according to their respective\\nmarket shares:\\n1. Ford (9.4 percent). The most popular models include the F-150 pickup and the Explorer sports\\nutility vehicle. (American sports utility vehicles in general are becoming increasingly popular with the\\naffluent.) About three in ten millionaire Ford drivers own F-150 pickups. About one in four drive Ford\\nExplorers. Note that the F-150 pickup is the number-one vehicle sold in America. Thus, drivers of\\npickups have something in common with many millionaires.\\n2. Cadillac (8.8 percent). More than 60 percent of Cadillac owners drive the De Ville/Fleetwood\\nBrougham.\\n3. Lincoln (7.8 percent). About half have Lincoln Town Cars.\\n4. A three-way tie: Jeep, Lexus, Mercedes (6.4 percent each). Almost all millionaires who own Jeeps\\nchoose the Grand Cherokee sports utility model. In fact, this model ranks first among all models\\nowned by millionaires. Nearly two-thirds of Lexus drivers choose the LS 400 model. The favorite\\nmodel of Mercedes-Benz is the S Class.\\n5. Oldsmobile (5.9 percent). The overall favorite model is the Olds 98.\\n6. Chevrolet (5.6 percent). Ten different models are represented. The most popular include the\\nSuburban and the Blazer sports utility vehicles.\\n7. Toyota (5.1 percent). The Camry model accounts for more than half of this segment.\\n8. Buick (4.3 percent). The Le Sabre and Park Avenue models were found to be most popular.\\n9. A two-way tie: Nissan and Volvo (2.9 percent each). The most popular Nissan is the Pathfinder\\nsports utility vehicle; for Volvo, it is the 200 Series.\\n10. A two-way tie: Chrysler, Jaguar (2.7 percent each).\\nOther popular makes include Dodge, BMW, Mazda, Saab, Infiniti, Mercury, Acura, Honda, GMC,\\nVolkswagen, Land Rover, Subaru, Pontiac, Audi, Isuzu, Plymouth, and Mitsubishi. The top three\\nmanufacturers are General Motors Corporation, with approximately 26.7 percent of the millionaire\\npopulation; Ford Motor Company, with 19.1 percent; and Chrysler, with about 11.8 percent. As you\\ncan see, most millionaires are driving so-called Detroit metal. Most Americans who own motor\\nvehicles also drive Detroit metal. How then can you tell if your neighbor who is driving a Ford, a\\nCadillac, or a Jeep is a millionaire or not? You can’t. It’s not easy to judge the wealth characteristics\\nof people by the motor vehicles they drive.\\nAn increasing number of affluent people are purchasing vehicles produced by American', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='manufacturers, especially Buicks, Cadillacs, Chevrolets, Chryslers, Fords, Lincolns, and Oldsmobiles.\\nThis trend is related to the growing popularity of sports utility vehicles produced by Chrysler, Ford,\\nand General Motors. What is it about Detroit metal that appeals to the wealthy? We can answer that\\nquestion by reflecting on something that took place more than fifteen years ago.\\nAfter interviewing a group of ten millionaires, we walked into the parking lot of the research\\nfacility. We were very surprised to see that almost all of the millionaires we had just interviewed were\\ndriving full-sized Detroit metal, including Buicks, Fords, and Oldsmobiles. We looked at each other;\\none said: “These people are not into status; they buy automobiles by the pound!”\\nIt’s true. Many American millionaires have a propensity to purchase full-sized automobiles that\\nhave a low cost per pound. The average per pound price for all new motor vehicles is $6.86. The full-\\nsized Buick four-door sedan currently sells for less than $6.00 a pound; the Chevrolet Caprice, about\\n$5.27 per pound; the Ford Crown Victoria, about $5.50; the Lincoln Town Car, less than $10.00 a\\npound; and the Cadillac Fleetwood, $8.26 a pound. The Ford Explorer sells for about $5.98 a pound.\\nThe most popular model among millionaires is the Jeep Grand Cherokee, which sells for $7.09 per\\npound.\\nHow do these costs per pound compare with those of full-sized foreign cars? The BMW 740 sedan\\ncosts more than $15.00 per pound; the Mercedes-Benz 500 SL is priced at more than $22.00 per\\npound; and the Lexus LS400 is now selling for more than $14.00 per pound. What about the Ferrari\\nF40? It’s $175.00 per pound! (The estimated price per pound for most currently offered motor\\nvehicles is provided in Appendix 2 of this book.)\\nMany affluent respondents take joy in driving vehicles that do not denote so-called high status.\\nThey are more interested in objective measures of value. Some millionaires do spend considerable\\ndollars for top-of-the-line luxury automobiles. But they are in the minority. For instance,\\napproximately 70,000 Mercedes were sold in this country last year. This translates into about one-half\\nof 1 percent of the more than fourteen million motor vehicles sold. At the same time, there were\\nnearly 3.5 million millionaire households. What does this tell us? It suggests that the members of\\nmost wealthy households don’t drive luxury imports. The fact is that two out of three purchasers or\\nleasers of foreign luxury motor vehicles in this country are not millionaires.\\nDomestic brands have long been in favor with older millionaires. We believe this attitude is\\nbecoming more common even among younger millionaires. Why? Because the real growth in the\\nmillionaire market continues to come from the entrepreneurial segment. Entrepreneurs, as a rule, are\\nmore price-sensitive than others when it comes to acquiring motor vehicles. Successful entrepreneurs\\njudge each expenditure in terms of productivity. They often ask themselves the impact heavy spending\\nfor motor vehicles will have upon their business’s bottom line and ultimately their wealth. More often\\nthan not, they determine that investments for such items as advertising and new equipment are much\\nmore productive than very expensive motor vehicles.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='PURCHASE BEHAVIOR\\nWhat thought and behavioral processes do millionaires go through before buying a car? We have done\\nextensive research on the various types of vehicle buyers that exist among the ranks of millionaires. It\\nseems that rich people differ significantly even among themselves. Studying these various findings\\nreveals valuable information about the attitudes and behaviors necessary to accumulate wealth.\\nThere are four distinct buyer types within the millionaire population. Underlying these four types\\nare two fundamental factors. First is dealer loyalty. Some buyers have a proclivity to patronize the\\nsame dealer over and over again. In other words, when “dealer loyalists” want to acquire a motor\\nvehicle, they are inclined to work with the dealer who sold them their last vehicle (and the vehicle\\nbefore that). About 45.7 percent of the affluent are dealer loyalists (see Table 4-3).\\nAll the other millionaires are shoppers. They account for 54.3 percent of the population. These\\npeople have no desire to patronize the same dealer. They are very aggressive, price-oriented buyers.\\nOften they take months to make their price-related vehicle purchase.\\nThe second factor underlying buyer types is vehicle choice—new or used. Among the affluent, 63.4\\npercent prefer and buy new cars. The balance, 36.6 percent, have a very strong proclivity to purchase\\nused vehicles only. Putting these two factors together produces four types of millionaire car buyers\\n(see Table 4-3):\\n♦ Type 1: New Vehicle-Prone Dealer Loyalists (28.6 percent)\\n♦ Type 2: New Vehicle-Prone Dealer Shoppers (34.8 percent)\\n♦ Type 3: Used Vehicle-Prone Dealer Loyalists (17.1 percent)\\n♦ Type 4: Used Vehicle–Prone Shoppers (19.5 percent).\\nNEW VEHICLE-PRONE DEALER LOYALISTS (28.6 PERCENT)\\nPeople with this orientation buy new vehicles only and have at least conditional loyalty to a dealer or\\nset of dealers. Most affluent people have strong make/brand preferences concerning motor vehicles.\\nSo when they decide to buy a particular make of vehicle, loyalists already have a dealer in mind. They\\nsee certain benefits in buying new vehicles from the same dealer(s). But this doesn’t mean they walk\\ninto their favorite dealership, lie down, and roll over. On the contrary, price—even for them—is an\\nimportant consideration. Perhaps you think these dealer loyalists are lazy. Could they be members of\\nthe so-called idle rich? No, this is not the reason they patronize the same dealer again and again.\\nPerhaps you might speculate that these buyers just like their dealer. Well, affection is not the answer\\neither.\\nTABLE 4-3\\nMOTOR VEHICLE ACQUISITION ORIENTATIONS OF MILLIONAIRES', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Quite simply, new vehicle-prone dealer loyalists prefer to minimize their effort in choosing both a\\ndealer and their type of vehicle (i.e., new versus used). New vehicle-prone loyalists put a tremendous\\namount of time and effort into generating their high incomes. They believe thereis significantly more\\nmoney to be gained from working than from going from dealer to dealer or looking for a “real buy” on\\na used vehicle. This group patronizes particular dealers because they also feel that these sellers give\\nthem the best packages overall. Some of the components of “these packages” go far beyond the price\\nand physical dimensions of a motor vehicle.\\nWhy do these millionaires purchase new vehicles instead of used ones? Why are they less sensitive\\nto the price variations of vehicles than are buyers of used cars? First, purchasers of new vehicles like\\nnew vehicles, although this is not the only reason they buy them. In their minds, buying new instead of\\nused is much simpler; it requires less time and effort. To them, new vehicles are more reliable and\\nmore readily available in the models and colors and with the accessories they demand. In essence,\\nthey feel they must pay more to get more.\\nYet price is somewhat important even for this group. Before they visit their favorite dealer, nearly\\nhalf (46 percent) determine the dealer’s cost of a particular model. About one in three contacts at least\\ntwo competing dealers to get “some feel for the impending deal.” Some study consumer magazines\\nand other periodicals and price guides that reveal dealer cost figures. Location is another factor in\\nunderstanding the behavior of this group. Many will contact dealers who are located outside their\\ntrade area, but most of these contacts are made merely to test local offers. Only about one in ten\\npatronizes out-of-town dealers repeatedly.\\nThere is another factor that explains the orientation of new vehicle-prone dealer loyalists:\\nMore than one in five patronize dealers who are their clients or customers.\\nNetworking is alive and well among the affluent in America. Many wealthy self-employed business', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='owners believe strongly in reciprocity. Think for a moment. If you were a paving contractor, for\\nexample, where would you go to buy your vehicles? Would you buy from a stranger with a firm\\nhandshake, or from the automobile dealer who just gave you a contract to pave his parking lot? The\\nanswer should be obvious.\\nMany loyalists who are self-employed professionals, such as physicians, attorneys, CPAs, financial\\nplanners, and architects, also believe in this kind of reciprocity. The more enlightened ones tend to\\npatronize those vehicle dealers who patronize them. It is not at all unusual for the owner of a\\ndealership to have more than one hundred different suppliers who provide his business with products\\nand services. Accordingly, there is some expectation on his part that these suppliers will return the\\nfavor. Many affluent dealer loyalists receive customer referrals from car dealers whom they patronize.\\nIn turn, 25.5 percent of the loyalists indicate that they refer their associates and friends to selected\\ndealers. The dealers reciprocate by giving these buyers significant price discounts on their purchases.\\nMany millionaires are dealer loyal for another reason. About 20 percent patronize dealerships that\\nare owned by a relative or close personal friend. Many also prefer to deal directly with the owner of\\nthe dealership they patronize; 37 percent deal exclusively with the owners. Why? Because they believe\\nthis will assure them of getting an excellent overall package.\\nNEW VEHICLE-PRONE DEALER SHOPPERS (34.8 PERCENT)\\nThe affluent with this orientation believe that the price discounts they get through aggressive shopping\\nand negotiating with multiple dealers are more than worth the time and energy exerted. On average,\\nthey have spent about 9 percent less than new vehicle-prone dealer loyalists for the most expensive\\nmotor vehicle they ever purchased. On their most recent purchase, they paid about 14 percent less than\\nloyalists.\\nLoyalists tend to purchase somewhat more expensive cars, which accounts for about half the\\nvariation in the average prices paid by members of the two groups. In contrast, new vehicle-prone\\ndealer shoppers are more sensitive to the price variations of competing dealers. Shoppers are typically\\nexperienced negotiators; many enjoy shopping and haggling. In contrast with dealer loyalists, dealer\\nshoppers are significantly less likely to patronize dealerships owned by relatives or close personal\\nfriends, to refer others to dealers who reciprocate by giving them significant price discounts, to\\npurchase exclusively from the owners of dealerships, or to buy from dealers who do business with\\nthem. On the other hand, they are much more likely to take weeks—even months—”to shop around for\\nthe very best deal,” demand a“dealer-cost” or “below-cost” price, or “purchase a new model that is\\nheavily discounted and resell it within a year or two at nearly the same or higher price.”\\nBIDDING FOR YOUR BUSINESS\\nIf you dread the thought of shopping in person for your next motor vehicle, consider an alternative\\nmethod. Mr. Mark R. Stuart is a friend of ours who has purchased many motor vehicles by visiting\\ncompeting dealers. But he had never purchased a sports utility vehicle until this year. Although he\\nlacked experience with buying this kind of vehicle, he thought of a way to avoid spending countless\\nhours visiting competing dealers. Below is the fax that Mr. Stuart sent to the sales managers of six\\nlocal area Ford dealers.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Three sales managers responded immediately by faxing their very competitive bids to Mr. Stuart,\\nwho accepted one of these.

Thanks.\\nUSED VEHICLE-PRONE DEALER LOYALISTS (17.1 PERCENT)\\nWhy do millionaires such as those in this group with annual incomes in excess of $300,000 and a net\\nworth of nearly $4 million have to buy used vehicles? They don’t.\\nOverall, these millionaires get more satisfaction from acquiring used instead of new. In purchasing\\ncars that are two or three years old, they feel that the original owner has paid while the vehicle was\\ndepreciating in value. They often plan to resell their used acquisition in two or three years and recoup\\nmuch of their initial payout. Many also feel that aggressive bargain shopping for new vehicles is a\\nwaste of time and energy. They believe that new cars are overpriced at the manufacturer’s or\\nwholesale level; in their minds, one can’t even hope to buy a new vehicle for much less than the dealer\\npaid for it. For many, the real discounts on motor vehicles can be found in the used-vehicle market.\\nUsed vehicle-prone dealer loyalists have the highest percentage of entrepreneurs among their ranks.\\nEntrepreneurs are extremely price-sensitive when acquiring motor vehicles. Their preference to invest\\nmuch of their income in assets that appreciate, however, must be balanced with the need of many\\nsuccessful entrepreneurs to drive quality motor vehicles. For this group, the acquisition of quality\\nlate-model used vehicles is the solution. Their favorite makes/models include used Jeep Cherokees,\\nCadillac De Villes, Ford F-150 pickups and Explorers, Lincoln Town Cars, Chevrolet Caprices and\\nSuburbans, and Infiniti Q45s.\\nThe members of this group spend less money on such acquisitions than do the members of either of\\nthe new vehicle-prone groups. The percentage of their incomes allocated for motor vehicle purchases', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='is also the lowest of all the groups. On average, they spent only 7.6 percent of their income on their\\nmost recent acquisition, and only 9.9 percent for their most expensive purchase. As a percentage of\\ntheir net worth, these purchases represent only 0.68 and 0.89 percent of their net worth respectively.\\nHow do the members of this group make purchase and dealer patronage decisions? First, most\\ndetermine the dealer cost on a new model of their preferred vehicle. Then they determine the vehicle’s\\nprojected depreciation. This information is used to bolster their decision to purchase a used version of\\ntheir chosen model. Information about the current retail and wholesale value of used vehicles is\\navailable at many libraries and book stores. Often, enlightened CPAs provide this information to their\\nclients.\\nUsed vehicle-prone dealer loyalists then examine the offerings of several dealers. This is done to\\njudge the willingness of local area dealers to “earn the business” of the members of this group. Some\\ncheck the prices of vehicles offered by individuals as listed in the classifieds. Often, they telephone\\nthose listing their vehicles and ask private-party sellers if they would be willing to lower their asking\\nprice. In most cases, the callers are just conducting price-sensitivity research. The used vehicle-prone\\ndealer loyalist uses the information he gathered as a bargaining chip in negotiating with his chosen\\ndealer(s). In most cases, the chosen dealer will meet or beat the prices offered by the so-called\\ncompetition.\\nMillionaires in this buyer group patronize the same dealer(s) repeatedly. Buyers feel that repeat\\npatronage can earn them price and even service concessions, but this is not the only reason for their\\nloyalty. Like many new vehicle-prone dealer loyalists, 36 percent of used vehicle-prone dealer\\nloyalists told us that they buy used cars from dealers who do business with them. Many also patronize\\ndealers who go out of their way to refer customers to them. Remember that this group contains a high\\nconcentration of entrepreneurs, self-employed professionals, and very successful sales and marketing\\ntypes. Obviously, they believe in reciprocity. About one in four acquires his vehicle from relatives or\\nclose friends who are in the automotive industry. One in three used vehicle-prone dealer loyalists\\nmakes his purchase by negotiating exclusively with the owner of the dealership. One in five deals\\nexclusively with the top sales professional at a chosen dealership. Such buyers feel that top sales\\nprofessionals have great leverage in persuading sales managers to agree to sell at low prices.\\nUSED VEHICLE-PRONE SHOPPERS (19.5 PERCENT)\\nThose in this group are the most price-sensitive and the most aggressive bargain hunters of all those\\nwe have profiled. They spend less on average than do the members of any of the other groups. They\\npaid an average of $22,500 for their most recent acquisition, under $30,000 for their most expensive.\\nTheir latest purchase represents less than 0.7 percent of their wealth; their most expensive acquisition,\\nless than 0.9 percent. This group contains the smallest proportion who have clients, friends, or\\nrelatives in the automotive industry. Given that they don’t have a friend in the automobile business,\\nhow do they go about finding a good deal? First and foremost, they don’t buy new vehicles. Also, you\\nwill note that the title of this group—used vehicle-prone shoppers—does not contain the word dealer.\\nThese people buy their used vehicles from all types of seller. Most often they buy from private parties,\\nbut they often shop at dealerships, leasing companies, financial institutions, consignment companies,\\nauction companies, and agents.\\nUsed vehicle-prone shoppers are extremely patient people. They are the most likely of all\\nmillionaire car buyers to take months to find the best overall deal. They never seem to be in a hurry to\\nbuy. In some ways, they are always looking for a deal. They are in a semi-searching/buying state all', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='the time.\\nIn one instance, a member of this group casually looked around for a deal on a late-model Chevrolet\\nfor more than seven months. But unlike Dr. South from Chapter 3, this bargain shopper never spent a\\ngreat deal of time making this acquisition. It seems that on his long commute to work, he routinely\\npassed by three dealers. If he noticed a vehicle that caught his eye, he would contact the dealer by\\nphone. At the same time he would telephone sellers who had their vehicles listed in the classifieds. He\\neventually made a purchase from a private party at a price substantially lower than at any dealer he\\nhad contacted. He told the seller:\\nI am not in a hurry. Give me a call in a month or so and I’ll make you an offer. But right\\nnow you’re asking nearly as much as all the dealers I have been in contact with in the past\\nfew weeks.\\nHe tells the same thing to all the people he contacts.\\nHe also has a favorite time of the year to negotiate. He claims he is most successful in cutting deals\\nfrom the last two weeks of December into February. During the winter season, he says, sellers don’t\\nfind a lot of shoppers out and about. Christmas-related expenses and activities and the cold weather\\ndistract and discourage most potential buyers from shopping during this period. They do not\\ndiscourage many used vehicle-prone shoppers. It is not at all unusual for buyers in this group to have\\nfour or more sellers competing simultaneously for their business during these months!\\nThe members of this group typically acquire low-mileage vehicles that are two to four years old.\\nTheir favorite makes include Fords, Mercedes, Cadillacs, Lexuses, Chevrolets, Nissans, and Acuras.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='WHAT BUYING HABITS REVEAL\\nOne can learn a great deal about affluent people by analyzing their vehicle-buying habits. For\\ninstance, note that most millionaires are dealer shoppers as opposed to dealer loyalists. Not by a large\\nmargin (54.3 versus 45.7 percent), you may logically counter. But this margin is a bit misleading. Net\\nout the percentage of dealer loyalists who are so inclined because they have strong reciprocal\\nrelationships with their favorite dealer. Factor out also those loyalists who patronize dealerships\\nowned by relatives and close personal friends. Then ask about the percentages of loyalists versus\\nshoppers. If you do, you will find that there are at least two shoppers for every loyalist among the\\nranks of American millionaires.\\nWhat about vehicle purchasers in general? Most vehicle buyers are not wealthy. Thus, one might\\nlogically expect them to spend more time and energy shopping for the best deal. Our research shows\\nthe opposite. Those who are not wealthy are less likely to shop, haggle, and negotiate than those who\\nare millionaires. Car-buying behavior does indeed help explain why some people are wealthy while\\nmost are not and never will be.\\nMore aggressive bargain shoppers for motor vehicles also tend to bargain hunt for other consumer\\nproducts. These people also tend to plan their expenditures. Given these findings, what buyer type\\nofthe four profiled above would you expect to be the most frugal in general?\\nHave you guessed that it is the used vehicle-prone shoppers? Used vehicle-prone shoppers are the\\nmost aggressive and most price-sensitive when it comes to acquiring motor vehicles. They shop using\\na wide variety of sources. And, on average, they pay significantly less for their vehicles than do\\nmembers of the other groups.\\nOf all the types studied, used vehicle-prone shoppers are the most illuminating for those interested\\nin studying the path to affluence. Why? Because of all the groups studied, its members have the\\nhighest ratio of net worth dollars for each dollar of income: For every one dollar used vehicle-prone\\nshoppers realize in income, they have $17.2 of net worth. They have the lowest average income of all\\nthe groups, yet, on average, they have been able to accumulate more than $3 million. How did they do\\nit? Their wealth development strategy is worth detailing.\\nMILLIONAIRES WHO ARE USED VEHICLE-PRONE SHOPPERS\\nWhat factors explain variations in wealth accumulation? Income is a factor. People with higher\\nincomes are expected to have higher levels of wealth. But note again that members of this group of\\nused-vehicle buyers have a significantly lower income than the average for the other groups of\\nmillionaires. About two-thirds have incomes in the high-five-or low-six-figure range.\\nOccupation is another factor. We have noted many times that entrepreneurs account for a\\ndisproportionately large share of the millionaires in America. Conversely, most of the other high-\\nincome-producing occupations contain disproportionately smaller portions of high-net worth types.\\nThese include physicians, corporate middle managers, executives, dentists, accountants, attorneys,\\nengineers, architects, high-income-producing civil servants, and professors. But there are exceptions.\\nFor example, each of these nonentrepreneurial occupations is represented in the used vehicle-prone\\nshopper group we are profiling.\\nUsed vehicle-prone shoppers are unique even among their millionaire cohorts. Note that, on\\naverage, they have the highest score values on all seven measures of frugality (see Table 4-4).', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='TABLE 4-4\\nECONOMIC LIFESTYLES OF MOTOR VEHICLE ACQUISITION TYPES\\nBehind their frugal behavior is a strong set of beliefs. First, they believe in the benefits of being\\nfinancially independent. Second, they believe that being frugal is the key to achieving independence.\\nThey inoculate themselves from heavy spending by constantly reminding themselves thatmany people\\nwho have high-status artifacts, such as expensive clothing, jewelry, cars, and pools, have little wealth.\\nThey often tell the same thing to their children. In one case we studied, a youngster had once asked his\\ndad why their family didn’t have a swimming pool. His dad answered with the “big-hat-no-cattle”\\nresponse that many frugal people articulate. He told his son that they could have a pool installed, but\\nthat a new pool would mean the family would not be able to send the son to Cornell.\\nToday the son, Carl, is a Cornell graduate. No, his folks never had a swimming pool installed. What\\nwill happen when Carl’s children ask about their father’s proclivity to frugality? Will he be able to\\ndefend his purchasing orientation and his frugal nature in general? The answer to this question is\\nreflected in the results given in Table 4-4. Used vehicle-prone shoppers are significantly more likely\\nto report the following:', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='♦ My parents are [were] very frugal.\\nOnce a member of the used vehicle-prone shopper group told us about his frugal habits. He\\nexplained that his parents were farmers:\\nMy family in Nebraska understood the value of a dollar. Dad used to say seeds are a lot\\nlike dollars. You can eat the seeds or sow them. But when you would see what seeds turned\\ninto … ten-foot-high corn … you don’t want to waste them. Consume them or plant them. I\\nalways get a kick out of watching things grow.\\nThis man derived considerable enjoyment in his nondescript, four-door, three-year-old American-\\nmade sedan. He believed that his vehicle never revealed to the public that he was very affluent. Nor,\\naccording to him, would it ever encourage thieves to follow him home to burglarize his property. He\\noften referred to his car as “the last one that would ever be stolen out of the airport parking lot!”\\nFRUGALITY TRANSLATES INTO WEALTH\\nBeing frugal is a major reason members of the used vehicle-prone group are wealthy. Being frugal\\nprovides them with a dollar base to invest. In fact, they invest a significantly larger portion of their\\nannual incomethan do any of the other types of vehicle buyers. This also applies to their contributions\\nto pension/annuity programs. As you may have already predicted, the used vehicle–prone shopper\\ngroup also contains the highest percentage of prodigious accumulators of wealth. This group is\\nsignificantly more likely to agree with this statement:\\n♦ Our household operates on a fairly well-thought-out annual budget.\\nTo budget properly, one must keep records of disbursements. Here again, the used vehicle-prone\\nshopper is more fastidious than any of the other types. More of them agree that:\\n♦ I know how much our family spends each year for food, clothing, and shelter.\\nUsed vehicle-prone shoppers are also bargain-oriented when it comes to buying clothing. Their\\nscore of 145 was the highest overall (see Table 4-4). A significantly higher percentage agreed with\\nthis statement:\\n♦ I never bought a suit that was not on sale (discounted).\\nUsed vehicle-prone shoppers are significantly more likely to be discount-store patrons than other\\ntypes of vehicle buyers. This is evident from their positive response to the following statement:\\n♦ I often buy my suits at factory outlets.\\nIn addition, they are significantly more frequent shoppers at Sears than any of the other types of\\nmillionaire vehicle buyers.

Yet income is\\na positive correlate of wealth. What, then, is our message? If you cannot increase your compensation\\nsignificantly, become wealthy some other way. Do it defensively. This is how most of the used\\nvehicle-prone shoppers did it. They successfully inoculated themselves from contracting the high-\\nconsumption lifestyle that many of their neighbors adopted. More than 70 percent of their neighbors\\nearn as much or more than they earn. But fewer than 50 percent of their neighbors have a net worth of\\n$1 million or more.\\nMost of these millionaires’ high-income, low-net worth neighbors make the wrong assumption.\\nThey assume that by focusing their energy on generating high incomes, they will automatically\\nbecome affluent. They play excellent offense in this regard. Most are positioned in the top 3 or 4\\npercent or higher of the income distribution for all U.S. households. Most look the part of\\nmillionaires. Yet they are not wealthy. They play lousy defense. We have stated many times the belief\\nof countless millionaires who have told us:\\nIt’s much easier in America to earn a lot than it is to accumulate wealth.\\nWhy is this the case? Because we are a consumption-oriented society. And the high-income-\\nproducing nonmillionaire neighbors of used vehicle-prone shoppers are among the most consumption-\\noriented people in America.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='CASE STUDIES\\nMR.

Previously, the owner had dealt with another\\naccounting firm for years before realizing that this accounting firm had never referred one of its\\nclients to him.\\nNow the dealer and Mr. J.

He advised me about the upper-limit price I could\\nanticipate receiving for the car, and that was the price that we advertised. I have always meticulously\\nmaintained our motor vehicles. Our Legend had nearly every conceivable option, including the so-\\ncalled Gold Package. The car was always garaged. Our Acura dealer did all the prescribed\\nmaintenance and tune-up procedures. We even used Mobil One synthetic oil! The car had a good set of\\nMichelin MXV4 tires with a few thousand miles on them. And, perhaps most important, we had\\npurchased the car new. My classified ad outlined many of these characteristics.\\nAllow me to profile some of the characters who took the time to stop by and look over our car.\\nShopper One: a senior marketing officer, female\\nShe arrived driving an Infiniti Q45. When I saw the car, I asked her why she was interested in a\\nLegend, since her Q45 appeared to be nearly new. She told me that the Q45 was her husband’s and that\\nthey had purchased it used nearly a year ago. In fact, she had just finished looking over “previously\\nowned” Legends and Infinitis at several dealers. She made it very clear that her household had a used-\\nvehicle orientation. It was not particularly loyal to any make of automobile, but she and her husband\\ndid prefer a narrow set of vehicles. These included Acura Legends, Infiniti Q45s, and the Lexus 400\\nseries.\\nThe day she visited me, she had taken the afternoon off from work. She had a map of the Atlanta\\narea and had marked the location of selected dealers and the addresses of private sellers. In this way,\\nshe made it very clear to me that she was well aware of many “compelling” opportunities.\\nIt was obvious to me that this woman was very skilled in evaluating used cars. She immediately\\npointed to a small ding on the driver’s door. She examined the interior, the engine compartment, and\\nthe car’s sheet metal. Then she asked me why I had to sell the Legend. I responded by saying that “my\\nteenage children have an aversion to four-door sedans. To them, a Legend is well suited for middle-\\naged, unexciting people like their parents! They would much prefer even a well-used 4x4 sports utility\\nvehicle or a sporty two-door number.”\\nShe paused and reflected on my comments. Now that I think about it, I suspect she would have\\npreferred another answer. She would have wanted me to say that I was selling the vehicle because of\\nfinancial obligations. This would have put her in a much stronger bargaining position. Nonetheless,\\nshe attempted to negotiate a lower price. She asked, “What’s the lowest you are willing to take for the\\ncar?” I responded by telling her, “If I don’t sell it in thirty days, I will consider lowering the price.” I\\nthen pointed to the portfolio in the front seat, which contained all the maintenance records, original\\nwindow sticker, and so on. She turned around, got back in her husband’s previously owned Q45, and\\nleft. I never heard from her again. I am convinced that she found exactly what she was looking for—\\nthat is, a real deal on a late-model, used vehicle from someone who was in a hurry to sell.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Shopper Two: a vice president at a regional financial institution, male\\nYou may find it particularly interesting to learn this fellow’s specific job title. He was vice president\\nof the motor vehicle leasing department. I guess you could say he had an excellent understanding of\\nthe true value of motor vehicles. He also understood the relative advantages of buying versus leasing.\\nIt seems that this expert on leasing new vehicles spends his time searching for deals on used ones.\\nShopper Two was also looking for a real deal. He was interested in several makes of quality\\nJapanese cars, but, like Shopper One, had no great loyalty to any specific make. He spent a\\nconsiderable amount of time going over the maintenance and other records for the Acura. Then he\\nasked the same question Shopper One did: “Without you hitting me on the head, what is the least you\\nwould take for the Acura?” I gave him the same answer I’d given Shopper One. He also left. I am still\\nwaiting for his call.\\nShopper Three: a wealthy former business owner, male\\nShopper Three was the most interesting of the people with whom I came into contact. When he called\\nme, he mentioned that he was intending to drive his wife to a local shopping center. He asked about\\nour location, which he found ideal relative to the shopping center. He and his wife arrived shortly after\\nour phone conversation in a 5 series BMW. The car looked like it had just come out of a showroom.\\nSo I asked him about his need to purchase the Acura. He informed me that the BMW was his wife’s\\ncar. He then scrutinized the Acura from top to bottom.\\nWhile he was doing so, I had an interesting conversation with his wife. She informed me that her\\nhusband had recently sold his share in a successful software operation. They were millionaires. Her\\nhusband still acted as a consultant to the organization, but now he had more time to do other things.\\nShe also told me that her husband had never purchased a new car in the thirty years that they had been\\nmarried. Apparently, he is in a semi-constant search for real deals on automobiles. He is particularly\\nprone to purchasing quality used Japanese and German vehicles. But he is absolutely never in a hurry\\nto make such purchases. Like many people in the used vehicle–prone shopper group, he gets immense\\npleasure from finding good deals from private sellers with too much car, too little capital.\\nI suspect that is why he spent time debriefing me. He asked me what I did for a living. He asked me\\nhow well my business was operating. Perhaps he had thought I was an out-of-work corporate\\nexecutive. Why else would I be at home in the middle of the afternoon in my khaki pants and flannel\\nshirt? I told him I was an author, working on book number four. Then he inquired about how well my\\nother books were selling. “Great,” I answered. He then frowned and asked the question of questions:\\n“Would you be interested in knocking $1,500 off the asking price?” Again I responded, “Perhaps in\\nthirty days if I don’t sell it before then.” I am still waiting to hear from him, too! He did seem\\nimpressed with the way I maintained automobiles, so just before he left, he asked if I intended to sell\\nany of my other cars. He pointed to my high-performance Z28 Camaro. I had to turn him down on that\\noffer, too.\\nShopper Four: a schoolteacher, female\\nIsn’t it interesting that a disproportionately high number of used-car shoppers come from the ranks of\\nteachers and professors? Shopper Four called me late one Friday evening. (When do weekend', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='telephone rates go into effect?) She had a battery of questions to ask me. After this intense debriefing,\\nshe informed me that she lived several hundred miles from Atlanta in “cotton” country. She said she\\nwas in the process of calling many of the people who had listed Acura Legends in the Atlanta\\nclassifieds.\\nShe promised to get back in touch with me the following Wednesday. She kept her promise and\\nasked if I could fax her evidence that there were no outstanding liens on the vehicle. She also asked if\\nit would be possible to have a more detailed list of the car’s accessories. I faxed her the title and a\\ncopy of the original window sticker, with prices and options. She then advised me that she planned to\\ncome to Atlanta that Friday and look at several vehicles that were for sale.\\nShe and her husband, a successful cotton farmer, arrived at our house on Friday. They were driving\\na late-model Nissan Maxima. The automobile appeared to be in excellent condition. Shopper Four\\ndrove her husband and me around the community for about twenty minutes, test-driving the Acura.\\nDuring that time I had a chance to debrief them. Why did they drive all the way from cotton country?\\nWhy were they interested in buying a used vehicle? Aren’t farmers supposed to be frugal?\\nIt seems that this couple shops for a late-model, quality, used Japanese vehicle every two or three\\nyears. They find the prices and availability significantly better in the big city. (They are nearly 150\\nmiles from the nearest Acura dealer.) They buy cars like mine and resell them in two or three years in\\ntheir rural community for close to what they paid for them.\\nShopper Four and her husband convinced me that they were frugal. They arrived with a certified\\ncheck in an amount that was $1,000 less than my asking price. The farmer, upon returning from the\\ntest drive, asked his wife, “Aren’t you going to try to negotiate with this guy?” She, in turn, said, “This\\nfellow doesn’t need to sell this car. And it’s in great condition.” Her husband agreed. Thereupon, she\\nhanded me the certified check and ten $100 bills. After all the papers were signed and the deal was\\ncomplete, she told me that my car sold for at least $3,000more at the dealer nearest her farm. I\\nresponded that her colleagues would likely be impressed with this car when she drove up to school on\\nMonday. Her husband commented that the other teachers would really be impressed if they knew how\\nlittle she had paid for it.\\nOne comment he made was of particular interest to me: “My wife works with a woman who drives a\\nnew, comparably equipped MercedesBenz. She leased it for sixty months, $600 per month. Do you\\nknow how much cotton you have to grow to make those payments?”\\nA PROFESSOR OF THRIFT HAS UAWs FOR NEIGHBORS\\nHow did Dr. Bill, an engineering professor who never had a total household income of more than\\n$80,000, become a millionaire? He inherited nothing. He never won the lottery or hired an investment\\nadvisor who turned a few thousand of his dollars into a fortune. His success in accumulating wealth is\\nbased on living well below his means. This professor is a classic example of a used vehicle-prone\\nshopper. But like most of those in this buyer group, he never neglected his family. He provided funds\\nfor his children’s college tuitions in full and more. He and his family live in a fine home in an upper-\\nmiddle-class neighborhood. In fact, about 80 percent of his group live in homes valued at $300,000 to\\n$500,000.\\nDr. Bill’s goal always was to become financially independent, but he never wanted to become an\\nentrepreneur. Often, entrepreneurs become wealthy by taking substantial risks and by leveraging the\\nlabor and talent of dozens, even hundreds, of others. Dr. Bill was never cut out to be anything but a\\nprofessor. He is not alone. Most people in this country are not the entrepreneurial type. But this does', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='not mean that they can’t become millionaires.\\nPeople often confuse our message about the relationship between being wealthy and being an\\nentrepreneur. We’re not telling people to give up doing their own thing in medicine, law, accounting,\\nand other occupations and join the ranks of the entrepreneurs in this country. Don’t even consider such\\na change unless you really want to and are fully capable of succeeding. If you can generate a\\nreasonably good income—say, twice the norm for households in America, or $65,000 to $70,000—\\nthen you may become wealthy one day if you follow the defensive strategy developed by millionaires\\nwho are used vehicle-prone shoppers.\\nMost of Dr. Bill’s nonmillionaire neighbors have no household budget. They do no consumption\\nplanning. As a result, they have no restrictions on their domestic expenditures except one—the upper\\nlimits of their income. Yet these are the very types who are prone to whisper criticisms about frugal\\nneighbors such as Dr. Bill.\\nMr. Norman is an executive who lives in a $400,000 home in Dr. Bill’s neighborhood. His\\nhousehold income last year was in excess of $150,000. But he has next to zero invested in anything\\nother than home equity, motor vehicles, and a corporate pension plan. Mr. Norman’s household has a\\nnet worth of under $200,000. Mr. Norman and his wife are each fifty years old. So are their neighbors,\\nthe used vehicle-prone shopper, Dr. Bill, and his wife. Bill earns only about half of what the Normans\\nearn. But Bill’s household has a net worth that is nine times greater than the Normans. Can this be\\npossible?\\nIt’s more than possible. It is probable and predictable. Great offense and poor defense translate into\\nunder accumulation of wealth. But the Normans are not alone. There are many more under\\naccumulators in their neighborhood than there are prodigious accumulators like Dr. Bill and his\\nfamily.\\nUAWs like the Normans find it degrading to even think about shopping for a used car. To them, a\\nused car is out of the question. Their neighbor, Dr. Bill, never felt degraded shopping for quality used\\ncars. In fact, acquiring used “cream puffs” gives him great satisfaction. Over the years, he figures that\\nhe has saved enough buying used over new to completely fund one of his children’s college and\\ngraduate school tuitions.\\nWhere did Dr. Bill buy his latest motor vehicle, a three-year-old BMW 5 series? From Gary, a high-\\nincome, hyperconsuming sales professional employed in the high-tech field. Gary buys only new\\nforeign motor vehicles. If Gary is like most UAWs, he firmly believes that the buyer of his old 5\\nseries BMW is not as financially well off as he. This is one of the tell-tale symptoms of being a UAW.\\nUAWs usually think they have more wealth than their neighbors. Many UAWs also believe that\\npeople drive the best they can afford.\\nThink of this situation in another way. Gary, the under accumulator of wealth, is subsidizing Dr.\\nBill’s motor vehicle purchases. Gary takes the brunt of the three-year depreciation and then transfers\\ntitle of a fine automobile to Dr. Bill, the frugal millionaire. Also, since Gary is anemployee, he cannot\\nwrite off depreciation against his income tax liability. In addition, Gary has no friends, relatives, or\\nclients in the motor vehicle business. He gets no tax write-offs, no super discounts from an uncle or\\naunt who owns a dealership, and no reciprocity from a client/customer who is in the automobile\\nbusiness. He consumes motor vehicles purely for pleasure.\\nWhat should Gary, Mr. Norman, and others of the UAW variety know? That they spend more for\\nmotor vehicles than the typical American millionaire. Gary’s earned income is equal to that of many\\nmillionaires, yet Gary isn’t a millionaire. Perhaps he compensates for this through his heavy\\nconsumption of status products. Is he trying to emulate the driving and buying habits of the chairman\\nof the company that employs him? But the chairman is a millionaire and owns equity in the\\ncorporation. Unlike Gary, he never purchased an expensive automobile until after he was wealthy.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Instead, he put much of his income back into the company via stock purchases.

Her name is.\\nOr perhaps you could suggest another source that would tell us how much is in the trust.\\nThank you,\\nMr. L. S.\\nThe author of this letter and his wife urgently need money. The writer (we will call him Lamar) is the\\nhusband of a woman (we will refer to her as Mary) who comes from a wealthy family. Mary receives\\nmore than $15,000 in cash gifts annually from her parents. She has received gifts of this type, as well\\nas other forms of help, since she and Lamar got married nearly thirty years ago.\\nToday she and her husband are in their early fifties. They live in a splendid neighborhood in a fine\\nhome. They are country club members. Both love to play tennis and golf. Both drive imported\\nluxurycars. They wear fine clothes and are socially involved with several nonprofit organizations.\\nThey were previously active in raising money for the private schools their children attended. Both\\nenjoy vintage wines, gourmet foods, entertaining, high-quality jewelry, and foreign travel.\\nTheir neighbors think Lamar and Mary are wealthy. Some are firmly convinced that they are\\nmultimillionaires. But looks can be deceiving. They are not wealthy. Do they at least earn a high\\nincome? No, neither the husband nor the wife earns a high income. Mary is a housewife. Lamar is an\\nadministrator at the local college. Never in the couple’s long marriage have the two ever had an\\nearned annual income in excess of $60,000, even though they have a lifestyle similar to those with\\nincomes of at least twice theirs.\\nSome may suggest that this couple does an outstanding job of budgeting and planning. How else can\\nthey live so high with so few dollars of income? But Lamar and Mary have never put a budget plan\\ntogether in all the years they’ve been married. They spend in excess of their income every year. They\\nalso spend all the money Mary receives from her parents. In short, Mary and Lamar are able to live so\\nlavishly because they are the recipients of what we call economic outpatient care (EOC). Economic\\noutpatient care refers to the substantial economic gifts and “acts of kindness” some parents give their\\nadult children and grandchildren. This chapter will explore the implications of economic outpatient\\ncare, and how it affects the lives of those who give it and those who receive it.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='EOC\\nMany of today’s distributors of EOC demonstrated significant skill at accumulating wealth earlier in\\ntheir lives. They are generally frugal with regard to their own consumption and lifestyle. But some are\\nnot nearly as frugal when it comes to providing their children and grandchildren with “acts of\\nkindness.” These parents feel compelled, even obligated, to provide economic support for their adult\\nchildren and their families. What’s the result of this largesse? Those parents who provide certain\\nforms of EOC have significantly less wealth than those parents within the same age, income, and\\noccupational cohorts whose adult children are economically independent. And, in general, the\\nmoredollars adult children receive, the fewer they accumulate, while those who are given fewer\\ndollars accumulate more.\\nDistributors of EOC often conclude that their adult children could not maintain a middle-or upper-\\nmiddle-class high-consumption lifestyle without being subsidized. Consequently, an increasing\\nnumber of families headed by the sons and daughters of the affluent are playing the role of successful\\nmembers of the high-income-producing upper-middle class. Yet their lifestyle is a facade.\\nThese sons and daughters of the affluent are high-volume consumers of status products and\\nservices, from their traditional colonial homes in upscale suburbs to their imported luxury motor\\nvehicles. From their country club affiliations to the private schools they select for their children, they\\nare living proof of one simple rule regarding EOC: It is much easier to spend other people’s money\\nthan dollars that are self-generated.\\nEOC is widespread in America. More than 46 percent of the affluent in America give at least\\n$15,000 worth of EOC annually to their adult children and/or grandchildren. Nearly half the adult\\nchildren of the affluent who are under thirty-five years of age receive annual cash gifts from their\\nparents. The incidence of giving declines as adult children grow older. About one in five adult\\nchildren in their mid-forties to mid-fifties receives such gifts. Please note that these estimates are\\nbased on surveys of the adult children of the affluent and that gift receivers are likely to understate\\nboth the incidence and size of their gifts. Interestingly, when surveyed, gift givers report a\\nsubstantially higher incidence and dollar amount of gift giving than their adult children who are the\\nrecipients.\\nMuch EOC is distributed in lump sums or erratic patterns. For example, affluent parents and\\ngrandparents are likely to give their children entire coin collections, stamp collections, and similar\\ngifts in one transfer. About one in four affluent parents has already given such collections to his or her\\nadult children or grandchildren. Similarly, payment of medical and dental expenses is often\\nprecipitated by a grandchild’s need for orthodontal work or plastic surgery. About 45 percent of the\\naffluent have provided for the medical/dental expenses of their adult children and/or grandchildren.\\nDuring the next ten years, the affluent population in America (defined as those with a net worth of\\n$1 million or more) will increasefive to seven times faster than the household population in general.\\nDirectly paralleling this growth, the affluent population will produce significantly more children and\\ngrandchildren than in the past. Economic outpatient care will increase greatly during this period. The\\nnumber of estates in the $1 million or more range will increase by 246 percent during the next decade;\\nthese estates will be valued (in 1990 constant dollars) at a total of more than $2 trillion! But nearly the\\nsame amount will be distributed before millionaire parents become decedents. Much of this wealth\\nwill be distributed by so-called pre-decedent affluent parents and grandparents to their\\nchildren/grandchildren.\\nThe costs to provide outpatient care will also increase substantially in the future. Private school\\ntuition, foreign luxury automobiles, homes in fashionable suburbs, cosmetic medical and dental', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='services, law school tuition, and many other EOC items are increasing at rates that greatly exceed the\\ngeneral cost-of-living index.\\nIn addition, as our population ages, more and more affluent parents and grandparents are reaching\\nthe age of estate tax realization. Widows and widowers especially are becoming more aware that the\\ngovernment can take 55 percent or more of their estate via estate tax mandates. Thus, as the affluent\\ngrow older, they will increase the size and incidence of their EOC in order to reduce the tax burden on\\ntheir estates.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='MARY AND LAMAR\\nHow could Mary and Lamar afford the tuition to send their two children to private schools? They\\ncouldn’t afford it; Mary’s parents paid the bill. Unusual? On the contrary. Our survey research\\nindicates that 43 percent of the millionaires in this country who have grandchildren pay for all or part\\nof their private school tuition (see Table 5-1). We refer to such subsidies as third-generation\\neducational enhancements.\\nWe recently discussed this form of outpatient care with an audience of affluent grandmothers. We\\nprovided them with the results of our surveys. We did not endorse or criticize such behavior. After our\\npresentation, we answered questions.

Do you know about the problems with', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='public school around here? I’m sending my grandchildren to private schools.\\nIt is obvious to us that this grandmother is not completely at ease about providing economic\\noutpatient care to her daughter’s family. The real problem is not with the public schools; it is that her\\ndaughter’s family is in a situation of economic dependency. Mother hasdifficulty with the fact that her\\ndaughter married someone who is unable to earn a high income. Daughter and grandchildren may not\\nbe able to live in an environment congruent with Mother’s upper-middle-class background. So Mother\\nis determined to enhance the environment of her daughter’s family. She contributed heavily to the\\npurchase of a home that was economically out of reach for her daughter and son-in-law. The home is\\nin an upscale area where most of the residents send their children to private schools. The only way her\\nchildren can stay in such a high-consumption residential area is with heavy doses of Mother’s brand of\\neconomic outpatient care. But Mother fails to realize that such an environment has more drawbacks\\nthan does self-sufficiency, even if that means accepting a less affluent lifestyle.\\nMary is much like the daughter of the grandmother in our audience. Both have received economic\\noutpatient care. The donors in both cases made the same assumption: Economic outpatient care will\\n“get the youngsters going” and then won’t be needed anymore. Mary’s mother was wrong. She has\\nbeen providing her special blend of outpatient care for more than twenty-five years. Her daughter’s\\nfamily is economically dependent.\\nLamar has also benefited from outpatient care. Shortly after he and his wife were married, Lamar\\nquit his job to pursue a master’s degree. His own parents paid all his tuition and related expenses. This\\nis not at all unusual. In fact, 32 percent of America’s millionaires pay for their adult children’s\\ngraduate school education.\\nThe couple’s first child was born shortly after Lamar began his graduate studies. Mary’s mother did\\nnot like the apartment that the couple initially rented near the university Lamar attended. She took it\\nupon herself to send a cleaning crew over regularly to “freshen the place up.” But in her mind this was\\nnot the ideal environment for her daughter’s family. So Mother offered to help the couple buy a home.\\nLamar did help to make ends meet. He received a few hundred dollars each month from the\\nuniversity for his part-time job as a staff assistant. Mary did not work at that time. In fact, she has\\nbeen a fulltime housewife throughout her marriage.\\nMary’s mother placed a sizable down payment on the couple’s home. Nearly six in ten (59 percent)\\naffluent parents who have adult children tell us that they have provided their children with\\n“financialassistance in purchasing a home.” Mary’s mother also made the couple’s mortgage\\npayments. Note that 17 percent of the millionaires we have interviewed indicated that they have made\\nsuch payments (see Table 5-1). Initially, Mary’s mother was to provide these funds as an interest-free\\nloan. But eventually the loan was converted to a more conventional type. Forgiveness loans are\\nconsidered to be quite conventional among recipients of economic outpatient care. Sixty-one percent\\nof America’s affluent have provided such “loans” to their adult children. What happened when the\\ncouple traded up to a more expensive home? Mary’s mother once again subsidized the purchase.\\nEventually the couple moved to their current residence. Once again, economic outpatient care was part\\nof this purchase.\\nLamar spent nearly four years in graduate school. During that time he received two degrees. Today\\nLamar is a college administrator. But given his annual salary of less than $60,000, it’s still hard for\\nMary and him to make ends meet. Even with the $15,000 his mother-in-law provides each year, their\\nincome is not high enough to support their upper-middle-class lifestyle. What is so interesting about\\nMary and Lamar’s $60,000 annual income level is that they are not alone. About 30 percent of the\\nhouseholds in America that live in homes valued at $300,000 have annual household earned incomes', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='of $60,000 or less. Is it because of creative budgeting, or could it be a result of widespread economic\\noutpatient care in America? For the most part, it’s because of UAWs on EOC.\\nAccording to Mary, it’s not too difficult to pay for basic family necessities out of Lamar’s income\\nplus her annual cash gift from Mother. What is difficult is purchasing motor vehicles. And Mary and\\nLamar enjoy “foreign luxury.” How do they squeeze such purchases into their budget? Do they buy\\nused cars to reduce the “economic pain”? No, they purchase new cars every three years. Why so often?\\nBecause that’s Mother’s cycle. About every three years, Mary’s mother gives her daughter stock from\\nher portfolio—so do about 17 percent of America’s affluent. Some adult recipients hold onto such\\ngifts, but not Mary and Lamar. They sell the securities immediately, then purchase a new car with the\\nproceeds!\\nBut what will happen to Mary and Lamar after Mother is no longer alive? Obviously, this is a major\\nconcern to this couple. Unfortunately, we are not fortune tellers, so we were not able to tell them how\\nmuch Mother had in trust for her daughter. We wish them good luck. It will not take long for Mary\\nand Lamar to consume even a good-sized inheritance. They are already anticipating this economic\\nwindfall. A bigger home, a vacation home, and around-the-world travel are on the horizon.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='WHAT’S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?\\nAdults who sit around waiting for the next dose of economic outpatient care typically are not very\\nproductive. Cash gifts are too often earmarked for consumption and the support of an unrealistically\\nhigh lifestyle. This is precisely what happened to Mary and Lamar. Their household’s annual earned\\nincome of $60,000 is the same amount a blue-collar couple in their county earned with overtime. Both\\nthe man and woman drive buses for a living. Yet they have a more realistic view of who they are and\\nwhat they have achieved. Conversely, Mary and Lamar are living in fantasyland. Displaying upper-\\nmiddle-class status is their socioeconomic goal in life.\\nDoes this mean that all adult children of affluent parents are destined to become Marys and\\nLamars? Absolutely not. In fact, stated as a statistical probability, the more wealth parents\\naccumulate, the more economically disciplined their adult children are likely to be. Note that\\nAmerica’s millionaires are more than five times more likely than the average household to have a son\\nor a daughter graduate from medical school. They are more than four times more likely to have a child\\nwho is a law school graduate.\\nPaying for an education is the equivalent to teaching your children how to fish. Mary’s mother\\ntaught her daughter and son-in-law something else. She taught them how to spend. She taught them to\\nlook upon her as a fish-dispensing machine. There are many forms of economic outpatient care. Some\\nhave a strong positive influence on the productivity of the recipients. These include subsidizing your\\nchildren’s education and, more important, earmarking gifts so they can start or enhance a business.\\nMany self-made millionaires/entrepreneurs know this intuitively. Unlike Mary’s mother, they prefer\\nto give their offspring private stock, which cannot be readily traded in for a new foreign luxury\\nautomobile.\\nConversely, what is the effect of cash gifts that are knowingly earmarked for consumption and the\\npropping up of a certain lifestyle? We find that the giving of such gifts is the single most significant\\nfactor that explains lack of productivity among the adult children of the affluent. All too often such\\n“temporary” gifts affect the recipient’s psyche. Cash gifts earmarked for consumption dampen one’s\\ninitiative and productivity. They become habit forming. These gifts then must be extended throughout\\nmost of the recipient’s life.\\nThe subsidized lifestyle of many adults has another consequence. Neighbors see how Mary and\\nLamar live. What do they conclude? Too often it is that heavy spending is an acceptable way of life.\\nFor example, off and on for several years, Mary and Lamar have been on their neighborhood’s\\nwelcoming committee. Remember that the couple has also been active in fund-raising for the private\\nschool their children attended. What message do Mary and Lamar communicate to their new\\nneighbors? Recently, a hard-charging, very successful sales manager/vice president and his family\\nmoved into the neighborhood. The sales executive was only thirty-five years old at the time. He\\nearned nearly three times more income than Lamar. He and his wife had three school-aged children.\\nWithin ten minutes after welcoming his new neighbors, Lamar initiated his sales pitch. He told\\nthem that the public schools in the area were inferior but that he had a solution to this problem. Lamar\\nbegan to lecture his new neighbors about the benefits of the private school. The new neighbors\\nlistened attentively. Then they asked about the tuition. Lamar told them the costs were much less\\nsignificant than the benefits. The annual tuition at the high school, Lamar reported, was only $9,000.\\nLamar tells all his incoming neighbors the same thing—that is, that $9,000 is a small price for a great\\neducation. Why, of course, Lamar loves the school. It was a real bargain for him to send his children\\nthere, since Mary’s mother paid 100 percent of the tuition.\\nLater the sales executive and his wife did some research on the local public school system. They', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='found that it was far better academically than Lamar had told them. They decided that all their\\nchildren would attend public schools. They were pleased with the quality education provided there.\\nWhat is the value you place on a private school education, luxuryautomobiles, foreign travel, and a\\nlovely home? How sensitive are you to the prices of these products and services? Lamar is quite\\ninsensitive to high prices. The sales executive is just the opposite. Lamar finds it much easier to spend\\nother people’s money than his own. The sales executive, on the other hand, never received any\\neconomic outpatient care except for some of his undergraduate college tuition. The sales executive is\\nfully self-sustaining today. Why? Because he and his family do not receive economic outpatient care\\nearmarked for consumption. He spends much of his time enhancing his productivity by working\\nharder and investing wisely. Conversely, Lamar and Mary spend much of their time anticipating the\\nreceipt of stronger doses of economic outpatient care.\\nTHE QUESTION OF QUESTIONS\\nYou may ask, “Will I spoil my adult children if I give them cash gifts?” All the effects of cash gifts on\\nthe adult children of the affluent cannot possibly be presented in one chapter. And it is important to\\nnote that those who receive such gifts are not the “jobless dropouts” so often reported in the press.\\nThey are, in fact, likely to be well educated and to hold well-respected occupational positions. The top\\nten occupations of the adult children of the affluent are as follows:\\n1. Corporate Executive\\n2. Entrepreneur\\n3. Middle Manager\\n4. Physician\\n5. Advertising/Marketing/ Sales Professional\\n6. Attorney\\n7. Engineer/Architect/Scientist\\n8. Accountant\\n9. College/University Professor\\n10. High School/Elementary School Teacher\\nNevertheless, it cannot be denied that adult children who receive cash gifts differ from those who\\ndo not. Let’s contrast the wealth and income characteristics of adult children who do receive gifts with\\nthose who do not. Because age is highly correlated with both wealth and annual household income, it\\nis important to attempt to hold age constant when making comparisons between gift receivers and\\nnonreceivers. It is also useful to examine the differences in these two groups within each of ten\\noccupational classifications, since different occupational groups tend to generate different levels of\\nincome and net worth.\\nLet’s look at a survey of gift receivers and nonreceivers from all economic backgrounds, in their\\nearly forties to mid-fifties. Examine the numbers given in Table 5-2.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='TABLE 5-2\\nRECEIVERS VS. NONRECEIVERS OF CASH GIFTS: WHO HAS MORE WEALTH/HIGHER\\nINCOME?\\nNote that in eight of the ten occupational categories, gift receivers have smaller levels of net worth\\n(wealth) than those who do not receive gifts. For example, on average, accountants who are\\napproximately fifty years of age and receive cash gifts from their parents have only 57 percent of the\\nnet worth of accountants in the same age group who do not receive gifts. Further, accountants who\\nreceive gifts generate only 78 percent of the annual income of accountants who don’t receive gifts.\\nNote that cash gifts were not included in computing the annual incomes of accountants who receive\\ngifts. When these tax-free dollar gifts are added to the incomes of gift receivers, then, on average, gift\\nreceivers have approximately 98 percent of the average annual income of nonreceivers. In spite of\\nthis, they still only have 57 percent of the net worth of accountants who do not receive gifts.\\nAccountants who receive gifts are not the only occupational group that has lower income and net\\nworth characteristics. As you can see in Table 5-2, gift receivers in seven other occupational\\ncategories also have lower levels of net worth than nonreceivers, including attorneys, 62 percent;\\nadvertising/marketing/sales professionals, 63 percent; entrepreneurs, 64 percent; senior\\nmanagers/executives, 65 percent; engineers/architects/scientists, 76 percent; physicians, 88 percent;\\nand middle managers, 91 percent.\\nGift receivers in only two of the ten occupational groups have higher levels of wealth than\\nnonreceivers. In spite of having lower incomes than nonreceivers, gift receivers who are high\\nschool/elementary school teachers have higher net worths than nonreceivers. Teachers who receive', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='gifts have 185 percent of the net worth of the average for nonreceivers, but only 92 percent of the\\nincome. College/university professors who receive gifts have 128 percent of the net worth and 88\\npercent of the income of nonreceivers. Affluent parents can learn a great deal from gift receivers who\\nare teachers and professors. Teachers and professors who receive cash gifts have a much higher\\npropensity to accumulate wealth than do gift receivers in the other eight occupational classifications.\\nHow can one explain this peculiarity? To do so it is important first to explain why most gift receivers\\nin general have a lower propensity to accumulate wealth than do nonreceivers.\\n1. GIVING PRECIPITATES MORE CONSUMPTION THAN SAVING AND INVESTING.\\nFor example, affluent parents often subsidize their children’s purchase of a home. The intent may be\\nto help their children “get started on the right foot.” The parents assume that such gifts are a once-in-\\na-lifetime phenomenon. Some have told us that they thought “this would be the last dollar the kids\\nwould ever need.” They assume that the recipients of their kindness will be able to “do it on their\\nown” in the near future. Nearly half the time, they are wrong.\\nGift receivers frequently are underachievers in generating income. All too often the income of the\\ngift receiver does not increase at the same rate as his consumption. Remember, expensive homes are\\ntypically located in what we call high-consumption neighborhoods. Living in such neighborhoods\\nrequires more than just being able to pay the mortgage. To fit in, one needs to “look the part” in terms\\nof one’s clothing, landscaping, home maintenance, automobiles, furnishings, and so on. And don’t\\nforget to add high property taxes to all the other items.\\nThus, a gift of a down payment, whether full or partial, can place a recipient on a treadmill of\\nconsumption and continued dependence on the gift giver. But the majority of these recipients’\\nneighbors, more likely than not, receive no cash gifts from their parents. They are much more content\\nand confident about their lifestyle than most gift receivers are. Many gift receivers in such situations\\nbecome sensitive to the need for continued economic outpatient care. Their orientation may even\\ndramatically change from a focus on self-generated economic achievement to one of hoping for and\\ncontemplating the arrival of additional gifts. Underachieving income producers in such cases find it\\nnearly impossible to accumulate wealth.\\nGifts of down payments are not the only type that precipitate more consumption. Take, for example,\\nthe affluent parents who gave their son Bill and daughter-in-law Helen a $9,000 rug that we were told\\ncontained millions of hand-tied knots. Bill is a civil engineer who works for the state. He earns less\\nthan $55,000 a year. His parents feel compelled to help him maintain a lifestyle and level of dignity\\ncongruent with someone with a graduate degree from a prestigious university. Of course, the\\nexpensive rug looked out of place in a room filled withhand-me-down furniture and inexpensive light\\nfixtures. So Bill and Helen felt compelled to purchase expensive walnut dining room furniture, a\\ncrystal chandelier, a solid-silver service, and expensive lamps. Thus, the gift of the $9,000 rug\\nprecipitated the consumption of nearly that same amount for other “affluent artifacts.”\\nSometime later, Bill mentioned to his mother that the local public schools were not as good as they\\nwere when he was an elementary school student. His mother countered that she would pay for part of\\nher grandson’s and granddaughter’s private school tuition. Of course, it was up to Bill and Helen to\\ndecide if they should take their children out of the public school system. Mother paid two-thirds of the\\ntuition; Bill and Helen, the rest. In this case, a gift of $12,000 ended up costing Bill and Helen $6,000\\na year.\\nMoreover, Bill and Helen did not contemplate the additional expenses of sending their children to', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='private school. For example, they are often asked to make contributions to the school beyond the cost\\nof tuition. They also felt they needed to buy a seven-passenger station wagon so they could participate\\nin the school’s car pool. Books and related fees are also costly. And their children are now exposed to\\nother children and parents who tend to have higher-consumption lifestyles than were the case in the\\npublic school environment. In fact, their children are looking forward to traveling to Europe this\\nsummer. It’s part of their education and socialization process. Gift receivers are significantly more\\nlikely than non-gift receivers to send their children to private schools. (Although there are more\\nchildren of non-gift receivers in private school overall, it is because the population of non-gift\\nreceivers is much larger than its counterpart.)\\n2. GIFT RECEIVERS IN GENERAL NEVER FULLY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THEIR\\nWEALTH AND THE WEALTH OF THEIR GIFT-GIVING PARENTS.\\nPerhaps Tony Montage, a professional asset manager, said it best:\\nGift receivers … the adult children of the affluent feel that their parents’ wealth/capital\\nis their income … income to be spent.\\nOne of the main reasons gift receivers typically think of themselves as being financially well-off is\\nbecause they receive parental subsidies. And people who think they are financially well-off tend to\\nspend. In fact, statistically they are just as likely to view themselves as being affluent as are truly\\naffluent non-gift receivers. This is the case in spite of earning 91 percent of the income and having 81\\npercent of the wealth of nonreceivers.\\nLook at the situation from a gift receiver’s side of the equation. During each year of his adult life,\\nWilliam receives an annual tax-free gift of $10,000 from his parents. William is forty-eight years of\\nage. Ten thousand dollars of tax-free income could be viewed as the product of what amount of\\ncapital? Assume an 8 percent return. This would equate to $125,000 in capital. Add this amount to his\\nactual net worth. What is the result? William perceives himself as having $125,000 more in capital\\nthan he does.\\nConsider this analogy. Have you ever been confronted by an eight-year-old youngster standing in\\nthe front yard of his parents’ home? If you, a stranger, attempt to walk on to the property, Billy or\\nJanie will likely say, “You can’t come into my yard. This is my property.” Billy and Janie think that it\\nis their property. At the age of eight they may be correct. After all, they are children living at home.\\nAt this age kids feel that the yard, the home, and the car are family property. But as the majority of\\nBillys and Janies mature, they become properly socialized by their parents. They grow into\\nindependent adults, adults who can easily distinguish between what is theirs and what is not. Their\\nparents teach them independence.\\nUnfortunately, a growing portion of adult children are not being taught the value of being\\nemotionally and economically independent of their parents. How did one set of parents recently test to\\nsee if their adult son was independent? They used the “Montage Effect” as a basis for the test.\\nAfter Thanksgiving dinner at his parents’ home, James and his parents had a conversation. His\\nparents told James that they had decided to give several pieces of “their” commercial property to the\\nlocal private college. His father told his son, “I know you will understand that the college really will', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='benefit from such a gift.” James’s response, if written as a headline, might read:\\nSon of affluent couple screams, “That’s my property, too, and the college people can’t\\ncome in (to my yard).”\\nJames’s response was predictable. He has received substantial cash gifts from his parents\\nthroughout his adult life. He needed an annual gift equivalent to about 20 percent of his income to\\ncover his annual expenses. He viewed his parents’ idea of giving their capital to the college as a threat\\nto his future income.\\nLike many other gift receivers, James views himself as “self-made.” In fact, about two of every\\nthree adult children who receive significant cash gifts periodically from their parents view themselves\\nas members of the “I did it on my own” club. We are amazed when these people tell us in interviews,\\n“We earned every dollar we have.”\\n3. GIFT RECEIVERS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DEPENDENT ON CREDIT THAN ARE\\nNONRECEIVERS.\\nThose who receive periodic gifts of cash or its equivalent are euphoric about their economic well-\\nbeing. Euphoria of this type is related to their need to spend money. But much of this money is not in\\nhand. It is tomorrow’s economic outpatient care. So how do gift receivers respond to this dilemma?\\nThey use credit vehicles to smooth out their problems with cash flow. Why wait for the windfall at the\\nend of the rainbow? Adult children who receive cash gifts are more likely than other adult children to\\nlive in anticipation of the sizable inheritance eventually coming their way.\\nIn spite of having only about 91 percent of the total household annual income and 81 percent of the\\nnet worth of nonreceivers of gifts, gift receivers are significantly more likely to be credit-oriented.\\nThis credit is obtained for consumption, not investment, purposes. Conversely, nonreceivers of gifts\\nborrow more for investment purposes than do gift receivers. Otherwise, in nearly every conceivable\\ntype of credit product/service category, gift receivers outpace nonreceivers. This applies both to the\\nincidence of credit usage and to the actual dollars spent to pay the interest on outstanding balances. It\\napplies to personal loans and to unpaid balances on credit card loans. Gift receivers and nonreceivers\\nare not significantly different in their use of mortgage services or in the allocation of dollars for such\\npurposes. However, asignificant portion of the gift receivers were given money for sizable down\\npayments on their homes.\\n4. RECEIVERS OF GIFTS INVEST MUCH LESS MONEY THAN DO NONRECEIVERS.\\nWhen surveyed, gift receivers reported that they invested less than 65 percent of what nonreceivers\\ninvested each year. Even this is a very conservative estimate, since like most heavy credit users, gift\\nreceivers overestimate the amount of money they invest. For example, they often forget to take into\\naccount major credit purchases when computing actual consumption and investing habits.\\nThere are exceptions to this rule. Teachers and professors who receive gifts appear to remain as', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='frugal or even more so than those who receive no gifts. They are much more likely to save and invest\\nthe money they receive as gifts than are gift receivers in other occupational categories. The issue of\\nteachers and professors as role models is discussed more fully later in the chapter.\\nAs we have made clear, gift receivers are hyperconsumers and credit prone. They live well above\\nthe norm for others with comparable incomes. But often people mistakenly believe that gift receivers\\nare concerned solely with their own desires, needs, and interests. This is not the case. On average, gift\\nreceivers donate significantly more to charity than do others in the same income categories. For\\nexample, gift receivers who have annual household incomes in the $100,000 category normally donate\\njust under 6 percent of their annual incomes to charitable causes. The general population in this\\nincome category donates only about 3 percent. Gift receivers give in proportions that are much like\\nthose of households with annual incomes in the $200,000 to $400,000 bracket. These people give\\napproximately 6 percent of their income to noble causes.\\nNoble or not, gift receivers consume more, so they have significantly less money to invest. What\\ngood does it do to be well versed in investment opportunities when one has little or no money to\\ninvest? This is the situation in which a young professor of business recently found himself. He, a gift\\nreceiver, was asked to teach a course on investing for a continuing education program. His audience\\nincluded many well-educated, high-income people. The professor discussedvarious topics, including\\nsources of investment information and how to evaluate the stock offerings of various public\\ncorporations. The professor received high praise from his audience. He was well trained in his\\ndiscipline. He held a Ph.D. in business administration with a concentration in finance. However, near\\nthe end of the course, a gentleman from the audience asked the professor a simple question:\\nDr. E., may I ask about your personal portfolio? What do you invest in?\\nHis answer surprised most of the class:\\nI don’t have much of a portfolio at present. I’m too involved with paying two mortgages,\\nan auto loan, tuition….\\nLater, a member of the class told us:\\nIt’s like the fellow who wrote the book on one hundred clever things to say to attractive\\nwomen. But the guy did not know any good-looking women.\\nWhy don’t the financial advisors of under accumulating gift receivers emphasize thrift in their\\nmessages? All too often financial advisors have a narrow focus. They sell investments and investment\\nadvice. They don’t teach thrift and budgeting. Many find it embarrassing, even degrading, to suggest\\nto clients that their lifestyle is too high.\\nIn fairness, many high-income individuals as well as their advisors have no idea how much net\\nworth someone should have, given certain income and age parameters. Additionally, financial\\nadvisors are often unaware that their clients receive sizable cash gifts each year. Relying solely on a\\nclient’s earned income statement, they may likely say:', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Well, Bill, for a fellow who is forty-four years of age and who earns $70,000 annually,\\nyou’re doing pretty well. Pretty well in terms of your lovely home, boat, foreign luxury\\nautomobiles, donations, and even your investment portfolio.\\nWould the same advisor feel this way if Bill told him about the tax-free cash gift of $20,000 he\\nreceives each year from Mom and Dad?\\nIt is important here to emphasize a point made throughout this book. Not all adult children of the\\naffluent become UAWs. Those who do tend to have parents who heavily subsidize their children’s\\nstandard of living. But many other sons and daughters of affluent parents become PAWs. The\\nevidence suggests this happens when their parents are frugal and well disciplined and instill these\\nvalues, as well as independence, in their children.\\nThe popular press often paints a different picture. Too often they tout the “Abe Lincoln” stories.\\nThey dramatize those cases in which a child from a blue-collar background became very successful.\\nThey provide anecdotal evidence that the discipline of being poor is a prerequisite to becoming a\\nmillionaire in America. If that were true, one would expect there to be at least thirty-five million\\nmillionaire households in America today. But we know that there is only about one-tenth that number.\\nIt is true that most millionaires are the sons and daughters of non-millionaire parents, since the\\nnonmillionaire population is more than thirty times larger than its counterpart. Only a generation ago\\nit was more than seventy times larger. The enormous size of the nonmillionaire population has a great\\ndeal to do with why most millionaires come from nonmillionaire households. As a probability\\nstatement, millionaires are more likely to give birth to millionaires. Accordingly, the odds of\\nbecoming a millionaire are lower for individuals who are the products of nonmillionaires.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='A TEACHER AND AN ATTORNEY: A CASE STUDY\\nHenry and Josh are brothers, but having the same parents does not mean that these two people are\\nsimilar. Henry is forty-eight years of age; Josh is forty-six. Henry is a high school math teacher; Josh\\nis an attorney and a partner in a modest-sized law firm.\\nThe brothers are two of six children born to millionaires Berl and Susan, who accumulated their\\nmoney by operating a successful contracting firm. The couple has always been generous with their\\nchildren. Each year they have given Henry and Josh and their other son anddaughters approximately\\n$10,000 in cash. This gift giving did not stop when their sons and daughters became adults. Berl and\\nSusan felt that such gifts would help reduce the size of their estate and thus reduce the inheritance tax\\ntheir children would have to pay someday.\\nBerl and Susan also wanted to help their adult children get a good start in life. They felt that\\nfinancial gifts would help their children ultimately become financially independent. Berl and Susan\\nwere always democratic about distributing their wealth to their children. Each adult child received the\\nsame size cash gift each year. In addition, each child was given approximately the same amount of\\nmoney to help purchase a first home.\\nOne might expect that the children in such families would become financially independent.\\nCertainly, Berl and Susan felt this way. They always assumed that they themselves would have been\\neven more successful if they had attended college and subsequently received cash gifts from their\\nparents. But their parents on both sides were poor. Berl and Susan were successful because their\\nparents gave them something other than money. Each was the product of a disciplined home life. Berl\\nand Susan were not only well disciplined; they also taught themselves how to deal with adversity, and\\nadversity made them what they are today—successful millionaires. Tough times in the contracting\\nbusiness drive out the weak and unproductive. Berl and Susan were never weak of heart and always\\nran a highly productive, low-cost operation. This applied to both their business and their household.\\nEven today this couple has never owned a luxury automobile. They have never been on skis, never\\ntraveled abroad. Nor have they ever joined a country club. But somehow they assumed that if their\\nadult children could be exposed to the wisdom gained from college, travel abroad, and associating\\nwith higher-status people in general that they would outperform their parents economically.\\nBerl and Susan were wrong in making such assumptions. The children of affluent parents don’t\\nautomatically perform as well as their parents in terms of accumulating wealth. This is not to say that\\nthe Henrys and Joshes of America will never outpace their parents. Some do. But they are a minority\\namong all the children of the affluent. It’s important to note that the children of affluent parents have\\n(in today’s dollars) about a one-in-five chance of accumulating wealth in the seven figures during\\ntheir lifetimes, while the average child in this country whose parents are not millionaires has about a\\none-in-thirty chance.\\nAre any of the children of Berl and Susan millionaires today? No! But one is more likely to become\\na member of the seven-figure (net worth) club soon. Will it be Henry or Josh or one of the other\\nchildren? Berl and Susan’s other children are considerably younger than Henry and Josh. Certainly age\\nis a correlate of wealth accumulation. Young adults are not likely to have accumulated considerable\\nwealth on their own. Also, the other four children have not been receiving economic outpatient care\\nfrom their parents for the same length of time as their older brothers.\\nMany observers might predict that Josh would more likely accumulate a seven-figure level of net\\nworth before his brother. It is certainly understandable that they would feel this way. Attorneys\\ntypically generate significantly higher incomes than high school teachers. Once again, income is\\nhighly correlated with wealth accumulation. Last year Henry’s total household income (not including', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='the gift of cash from Berl and Susan) was $71,000; Josh’s Was $123,000. One would assume just from\\nthese figures that Josh would be much more likely to accumulate wealth. After all, his income is\\nnearly twice that of his brother’s. But observers who make such predictions overlooked the\\nfundamental rule regarding wealth building.\\nWhatever your income, always live below your means.\\nHenry, in spite of his smaller salary, lives below his means. Josh, on the other hand, lives\\nsubstantially above his income. In fact, Josh “really counts on that $10,000 from Dad and Mom to\\nkeep in balance.” The $10,000 added to his $123,000 income places him in the top 4 percent of all\\nincome-producing households in America. Remember that approximately 3.5 percent of the\\nhouseholds in America have a net worth of $1 million or more. But Josh has a net worth that even\\noptimistically estimated is well beneath that figure. His total net worth, including the equity in his\\nhome, law partnership, pension, and other assets is $553,000.\\nHow about Henry? In spite of his much smaller income, Henry has accumulated significantly more\\nwealth. Stated conservatively, his net worth is $834,000. How is it possible for a teacher to have so\\nmuch more wealth than an attorney with nearly twice the income?\\nStated simply, Henry and his wife are frugal; Josh and his wife areheavy consumers. Much of this\\ndifference is related to their respective positions. We find that, as a group, teachers are frugal.\\nAdditionally, attorneys who receive cash gifts from their parents spend more and save and invest less\\nthan do attorneys who are comparable in age but receive no gifts. As stated earlier, attorneys who\\nreceive cash gifts from their parents have only 62 percent of the wealth and 77 percent of the income\\nof attorneys in the same age bracket who receive no gifts (see Table 5-2).\\nWhere do teachers who receive gifts rank along the dimensions of wealth accumulation and\\nincome? Households headed by teachers who receive cash gifts from their parents have, on average,\\n185 percent of the net worth and 92 percent of the annual household income of those in the same\\noccupational and age category who do not receive cash gifts.\\nTeachers who receive gifts are more likely than nonreceivers to teach in private schools, which\\ngenerally pay their faculty lower salaries than do public schools. Perhaps unknowingly, many of the\\nBerls and Susans in America are subsidizing private schools by giving cash gifts to their adult\\nchildren. This, in turn, may encourage people like Henry to be willing to work for less money in a\\nprivate school. Henry may figure that since he receives economic outpatient care, he does not need to\\nearn a few thousand dollars more teaching in a public school. And although he teaches at a private\\nschool, Henry is quite comfortable driving his four-year-old Honda Accord or his wife’s minivan.\\nBy contrast, Josh is in a completely different environment. In fact, the office complex where he\\nparks his car is filled with imported luxury sedans and sports cars. Josh is responsible in part for new-\\nbusiness development for his firm. So even if he would like to drive a four-year-old Honda, his clients\\nand prospective clients might not wish to ride along with him. They might get the wrong impression.\\nJosh and his wife have three late-model automobiles. These include a 7 Series BMW and a seven-\\npassenger Volvo, both leased, and a Toyota Supra. His consumption habits regarding motor vehicles\\nare similar to those of other consumers who have significantly higher incomes. Josh spends three\\ntimes more on average than Henry for motor vehicles.\\nJosh also spends nearly twice as much as Henry in mortgage payments. Josh lives in a larger, more\\nluxurious home, in a so-called prestigious subdivision. Henry lives in a much more modest home in a\\nmid-die-class neighborhood. Henry’s neighbors are teachers, middle managers, civil servants, and', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='store managers. Henry and his family blend in nicely in this neighborhood. The consumption habits\\nthey display are very middle class. This is true even though Henry’s household has four to five times\\nmore accumulated wealth than its typical neighbor.\\nWhat about Josh’s neighborhood? His primary residence (he also has a time-share in ski country) is\\nin an upscale neighborhood. His neighbors are high-income-producing physicians, senior corporate\\nexecutives, top-earning sales and marketing professionals, attorneys, and affluent entrepreneurs. Josh\\nfeels comfortable in this environment, and it is ideal for entertaining clients as well as associates. But\\nthere is something Josh does not realize: Although his income is in the third quartile compared with\\nthat of his neighbors, he is near the bottom in terms of his household net worth.\\nJosh and his family are playing the role of those with two, three, and even more times the net worth\\nthey have. Josh, you are not alone. At least one in five households in your neighborhood is playing the\\nsame role. They, too, are on outpatient care. They, too, spend more and invest less than others in their\\narea.\\nHow does Josh’s budgeting system operate? How does it accommodate his propensity to spend?\\nJosh is like many other under accumulators of wealth. He spends first. He saves and invests what is\\nleft over. What this actually means is that he saves and invests nothing beyond what happens to be\\ninjected into his pension and profit-sharing plan. More than two-thirds of his wealth is the equity in\\nhis home, his partnership, and his pension. In essence, Josh and his family invest zero dollars from\\ntheir personal income. But perhaps they feel affluent anyway. Josh does receive $10,000 in cash each\\nyear. And he anticipates inheriting much more someday.\\nBut what about Josh’s children? Are they likely to receive substantial cash gifts from their father? It\\nis very unlikely. Yet these children are growing up in a high-consumption environment. They will\\nlikely attempt to imitate their father’s consumption behavior. This is a difficult act to follow,\\nespecially without the help of substantial outpatient care.\\nHenry’s children, in contrast, may be surprised to learn that their father has accumulated a small\\nfortune. Henry and his wife have never overextended themselves. Henry looks like a teacher, drives\\nwhatteachers drive, dresses like a teacher, shops where teachers shop. He has none of the designer\\nartifacts his brother owns. Henry has no pool, no sauna, no hot tub, no sailboat, no country club\\nmembership. He owns two suits and three sports jackets.\\nHenry’s activities are much simpler, cost much less, and are much less status-oriented. He exercises\\nby jogging every other day. He and his family are avid hikers and campers. They do own two tents,\\nseveral sleeping bags, and two canoes (one used). Henry reads a great deal and is active in his church\\nand its affiliated youth group.\\nHis simpler lifestyle translates into surplus dollars, which are saved and invested. During Henry’s\\nfirst year as a teacher, a senior member of the faculty advised him to enhance his investments by\\ncontributing to a 403b deferred annuity program. Henry has contributed to this program each year\\nsince he has been employed as a teacher. He has also invested most of the cash gifts his parents have\\ngiven him each year.\\nWho will be more likely to retire in comfort someday—Henry or Josh? Their parents are now\\ndistributing their capital not only to their children but also to their grandchildren. Thus, Henry and\\nJosh may inherit very little. At the rate Josh is consuming, he may never be able to retire in comfort.\\nHenry will likely retire with ease. Projections are that his combined pension, deferred annuity\\npackage, and investment portfolio will be substantial by the time he reaches the age of sixty-five.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='TEACH YOUR CHILDREN TO FISH\\nWhen we lecture about the relationship between cash gifts and economic achievement, people from\\nthe audience typically ask: “If not cash, then what form of gifts are more beneficial?” They are eager\\nto learn how to enhance the economic productivity of their children. Here again, we remind them that\\nteaching their children to be frugal is critical. Often those who are trained to be otherwise as children\\nbecome adult hyperspenders, needing cash subsidies during their young and middle adult years.\\nWhat intergenerational transfers could help your children become economically productive adults?\\nWhat should you give them? The affluent have a great appreciation for the value of a high-quality\\neducation. We asked millionaires if they agreed with the following statement:\\n♦ School/college learning is/was of little use to me in the real world of making a living.\\nOnly 14 percent agreed; 6 percent had no opinion; and the balance, 80 percent, disagreed. That’s\\nwhy millionaires spend a large amount of their resources on their children’s educations. What was the\\nmost frequently mentioned gift that millionaires received from their parents? Tuition!\\nAll other economic gifts are mentioned by a significantly smaller proportion of millionaires. About\\none in three received some financial support in purchasing his first home; about one in five received\\nan interest-free loan during his lifetime; only one in thirty-five ever received funds from his parents\\nfor mortgage payments.\\nWhat can you give your children to enhance the probability that they will become economically\\nproductive adults? In addition to an education, create an environment that honors independent\\nthoughts and deeds, cherishes individual achievements, and rewards responsibility and leadership.\\nYes, the best things in life are often free. Teach your own to live on their own. It’s much less costly\\nfinancially, and, in the long run, it is in the best interests of both the children and their parents.\\nThere are countless examples of the inverse relationship between economic productivity and the\\npresence of substantial economic gifts. Our own data, collected over the past twenty years, repeatedly\\nsupport this conclusion. Independent of college tuition, more than two-thirds of American millionaires\\nreceived no economic gifts from their parents. And this includes most of those whose parents were\\naffluent.\\nWEAKENING THE WEAK\\nSo what are affluent parents to do with their wealth? How and when should they distribute it among\\ntheir children? We will detail the distribution of wealth in the next chapter. But at this point, here’s\\nsome food for thought: Most affluent people have at least two children. Typically, the most\\neconomically productive one receives the smaller share of his or her parent’s wealth, while the least\\nproductive receives the lion’s share of both economic outpatient care and inheritance.\\nConsider for a moment that you are a typical affluent parent. You noted that your oldest son or\\ndaughter even at an early age wasextremely independent, achievement-oriented, and well disciplined.\\nYour instinct is to nurture these traits by not trying to control his or her decisions. Instead, you spend\\nmore time helping your less resourceful child make decisions, or you actually make decisions for him.\\nWith what result? You strengthen the strong child and weaken the weak.\\nSuppose you have a ten-year-old child who goes in for a physical checkup. The examining physician', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='tells you that your son or daughter is underweight and underdeveloped. How would you respond to this\\nevaluation? You would find ways to improve your child’s physical health. You would likely encourage\\nyour child to exercise, take vitamins, lift weights, and perhaps play sports. Most parents would attack\\nsuch a problem proactively. Wouldn’t you find it odd if the parent took the opposite course? How\\nwould you respond if the parent encouraged his child to eat less and exercise less?\\nAll too often this method of weakening the weak is applied to children who show personality-\\nrelated weaknesses. In one case we know about, parents were told that their son was deficient in\\nwriting and related verbal skills. How did the parents respond to this problem? First, they transferred\\ntheir child to another school. The verbal deficiency problem failed to improve, however, so the father\\nbegan writing his son’s papers. He still writes his son’s papers today. His son is a junior in college.\\nIn another case, an affluent couple had a twelve-year-old daughter who was very shy and rarely\\nspoke to anyone without some prompting. Concerned about her daughter, the mother wrote a note to\\nher daughter’s teacher, asking that the child’s seat be moved from the front to the back of the room,\\nsince her daughter felt more comfortable there. The mother reported that the “kids in front were too\\noften asked questions by their teacher.” The day the teacher received this request, she did not make\\nany changes in the seating. The mother called the teacher that afternoon to protest. The teacher was\\nunavailable, but she did return the call the next afternoon. Feeling slighted, the mother immediately\\ntransferred her daughter to another school.\\nIn yet another case, a distinguished professor recently received a telephone call from his neighbor.\\nThe caller was irate:\\nCaller: Dr_______, you’re in this business. I need your advice. How can I go about\\ngetting a professor fired? You probably don’t know this guy. He’s at the state university.\\nProfessor: Why do you want to have him fired?\\nCaller: My daughter is failing his course. He says she lacks the background to do well\\nin his class…. He has long hair. He never wears a suit…. He’s a jerk! I have already spoken\\nto his chairman. I’m getting the runaround. I want this guy fired.\\nProfessor: Well, why doesn’t your daughter just withdraw from the class?\\nCaller: Then she will have to go to summer school.\\nProfessor: There are a lot worse things than summer school.\\nCaller: If she goes to summer school, she can’t go to Europe with us. We have planned\\nthis trip for two years. Her mother won’t go without her daughter. What can I do?\\nWhat have all the parents done in these cases? They have contributed to weakening the weak. If\\nyour son has a deficiency in his verbal skills, make a commitment to overcome his handicap. In one\\ncase, a father recognized that his son had an extremely high aptitude in mathematics but that his\\nverbal skills were poor. His dad attacked the problem. Each night during dinner, Dad would ask his\\nson to define three words taken from the SAT study guide. During hundreds of dinner sessions, Dad\\ntutored his son. He also hired a professional tutor for him. This combination worked. Today his son is\\na graduate of a top Ivy League school—the one with the highest entrance requirements!\\nTHE PRODUCT OF EOC', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='What happens when “weakened children” become adults? They typically lack initiative. More often\\nthan not, they are economic underachieves but have a high propensity to spend. That’s why they need\\neconomic subsidies to maintain the standard of living they enjoyed in their parents’ home. We will\\nsay it again:\\nThe more dollars adult children receive, the fewer dollars they accumulate, while those\\nwho are given fewer dollars accumulate more.\\nThis is a statistically proven relationship. Yet many parents still think that their wealth can\\nautomatically transform their children into economically productive adults. They are wrong.\\nDiscipline and initiative can’t be purchased like automobiles or clothing off a rack.\\nA recent case study will help illustrate our point. A wealthy couple was determined to give their\\ndaughter, Ms. BPF, every advantage. So when Ms. BPF expressed some interest in starting a business,\\nthey responded in typical fashion. They created what they thought would be the ideal environment.\\nFirst, they wanted her to be debt free. So they put up all the money for their daughter to start her\\nbusiness. Ms. BPF put up nothing of her own. She never even applied for a commercial loan.\\nSecond, the parents felt a strong need to provide her with substantial economic outpatient care.\\nThey felt this would enhance their daughter’s chance of succeeding among the ranks of America’s\\nentrepreneurs. Ms. BPF’s parents believed their adult daughter would benefit from living at home.\\nThis way Ms. BPF could put all her energy and resources into her business. She would live with her\\nparents rent free. She would not have to allocate any time to shopping for groceries, cleaning the\\nhouse, or even making her bed. This ultimate form of subsidy goes beyond economic outpatient care\\n—call it economic inpatient care.\\nIs a rent-free environment ideal for a young entrepreneur? We don’t think so. Nor is the gift of a\\nbusiness. The most successful business owners are the ones who put much of their own resources\\nbehind their ventures. Many succeed because they have to succeed. It’s their money, their product,\\ntheir reputation. They have no safety net. They have no one else to rely upon for their success or\\nfailure.\\nThird, the parents of Ms. BPF added yet another element to the equation. What if their daughter did\\nnot have to worry initially about generating profits from her venture? They believed that reducing this\\nburden would enhance their daughter’s probability for success. Ms. BPF became yet another member\\nof the subsidized cluster. Her parents give her approximately $60,000 in cash and equivalents each\\nyear.\\nWhat is the result of having created this “ideal” environment? Today Ms. BPF is in her late thirties.\\nShe still lives at home. She has no commercial-related debts. Her folks financed her business and\\ncontinue to do so. Last year her business earned her nearly $50,000. Her parents continue to give her\\n$60,000 every year. They still feel that Ms. BPF will become truly independent sometime in the\\nfuture. We are not as optimistic as her parents in this regard.\\nMost successful entrepreneurs are not like Ms. BPF. How many entrepreneurs who are still in the\\nstart-up phase of their venture would do what Ms. BPF has recently done in one year?\\n♦ Purchased a $45,000 automobile without shopping or negotiating the price or conditions\\n♦ Paid $5,000 for a watch, $2,000 for a suit, and $600 for a pair of shoes\\n♦ Paid more than $20,000 for clothing in general', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='♦ Paid more than $7,000 for interest on credit card balances and revolving retail credit\\n♦ Paid more than $10,000 for dues/fees at area country clubs\\nThe answer is very few. Ms. BPF’s business is not really a success. It is heavily subsidized directly\\nand indirectly via other people’s money. Actually, Ms. BPF has been short-changed by her parents.\\nShe may never know if she could make it on her own. The “ideal” conditions they provided for their\\ndaughter were an incentive for her to spend heavily on consumer goods. All the while she gave her\\nbusiness stepchild treatment.\\nWho do you think has more fears and worries—Ms. BPF or the typical unsubsidized affluent\\nbusiness owner? Logic might suggest that Ms. BPF should have no worries at all, since she receives\\nintensive economic care from her parents. In fact, she has many more fears than do affluent men and\\nwomen who receive no subsidies whatsoever.\\nTypical affluent business owners have only three major concerns (see Table 3-4 in Chapter 3). All\\nof these are related to the federal government. They fear policies and regulations that are unfavorable\\nto business owners and the affluent population in general.\\nWhat does Ms. BPF fear? She told us that she had twelve major fears. How is it possible that a\\nperson who is almost completely insulated from financial risk has four times more fears than the\\ntypical affluent business owner? Because these affluent business owners have overcome most of their\\nfears. They have inoculated themselves from many fears by becoming completely self-sufficient. And it\\nwas the very struggle to become economically self-sufficient that helped these business owners\\novercome them.\\nWhat are some of Ms. BPF’s major fears and concerns? Remember, these are fears that are not\\nparamount among the self-sustaining affluent population. Ms. BPF has substantial fear of the\\nfollowing:\\n♦ Her parents’ estate being heavily taxed\\n♦ Experiencing a significant reduction in her standard of living\\n♦ Her business failing\\n♦ Not being wealthy enough to retire in comfort\\n♦ Being accused by her brothers and sisters of receiving more than her fair share of financial gifts and\\ninheritance from their parents\\nWho is more confident, more content, more able to deal with adversity? It’s not the Ms. BPFs of\\nAmerica. It’s those who have been brought up by parents who rewarded independent thought and\\nbehavior. It’s those who don’t concern themselves with other people’s money, who are more\\nconcerned about succeeding than about how much is in someone else’s estate. Also, if one lives below\\none’s means, one doesn’t have to be concerned with the possibility of being forced to reduce one’s\\nstandard of living. The parents of Ms. BPF have failed to obtain their objective. Their goal was to have\\na daughter who would “never have to worry.” But the method they used yielded just the opposite\\nresult. People often attempt to shelter their children from the economic realities of life. But such\\nshelters often produce adults who are in constant fear of tomorrow.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='THE PRODUCTS OF ZERO EOC\\nHow valuable is your signature?

But what risk has Ms. BPF ever taken? Very\\nlittle.\\nWebster’s defines courage as “mental or moral strength to resist opposition, danger, or hardship.” It\\nimplies firmness of mind and will in the face of danger or extreme difficulty. Courage can be\\ndeveloped. But it cannot be nurtured in an environment that eliminates all risks, all difficulty, all\\ndangers. That is precisely why Ms. BPF lacks the courage to leave home, expand her business, and\\nwean herself from heavy doses of economic inpatient care.\\nIt takes considerable courage to work in an environment in which one is compensated according to\\none’s performance. Most affluent people have courage. What evidence supports this statement? Most\\naffluent people in America are either business owners or employees who are paid on an incentive\\nbasis. Remember, whether their parents were wealthy or not, most of the affluent in America acquired\\ntheir wealth on their own. They had the courage to undertake entrepreneurial and other business\\nopportunities that were associated with considerable risk.\\nOne of the greatest entrepreneurs and extraordinary sales professionals of all time, Ray Kroc,\\nlooked for courage in selecting potential McDonald’s franchise owners and executives. Kroc actually\\nwelcomed cold-calling sales professionals. He told his secretary to “send all of them in.” Why?\\nBecause it’s not easy finding people who have the courage to be evaluated strictly on their own\\nperformance. He sold hisfirst franchise outside California for $950 to Sanford and Betty Agate (see\\nJohn Love, McDonald’s: Behind the Arches [Toronto: Bantam Books, 1986], pp. 78-79, 96-97). Kroc\\nfirst encountered Betty Agate while she was making cold calls on people in Chicago’s financial\\ndistrict. Kroc’s secretary asked, “What the hell is a Jew doing selling Catholic bibles?” “Making a\\nliving,” was her reply.

I was boarding an early-bird flight.\\nAlthough the plane had room for more than a hundred passengers, only about twenty people were on\\nboard. Soon after I sat down, we were told there was fog over the destination and that there would be\\nanother famous “short delay.” As I stood up, the woman (I’ll call her Laura) sitting in front of me also\\nstood up. I mentioned to her that I was displeased about having to get up so early to make this flight.\\nShe responded that she had been flying all night and still had one more leg in her flight.\\nI asked Laura why she was traveling at night. She replied that it was a lot more economical to do so.\\nWhat I found out shortly thereafter was that this woman did not have to fly via a highly discounted\\nticket. She, in fact, was affluent, but she was also very frugal. What was the purpose of Laura’s travel?\\nShe was en route to a conference of real estate executives, where she was to receive the Real Estate\\nExecutive of the Year award.

Wish you and\\nthe children good luck.\\nHow did Laura, a housewife with three small children, respond to this information? She was\\ndetermined not to return to her old job as a high school teacher. Nor would she ever ask her well-to-do\\nparents for economic support. She had grown up in an environment that nurtured independence and\\ndiscipline. She wondered what she could do with undergraduate and master’s degrees in English\\nliterature. She discovered that people with her educational background were in great supply and\\nreasoned that her income from her teaching, editing, and writing jobs were not likely to be enough to\\nsupport her family’s current lifestyle. Thereupon, Laura discussed various employment opportunities\\nwith several enlightened business owners in the community. After these discussions, she decided to\\ntry the field of real estate sales.

Laura was also the campaign manager for several of her friends\\nwho won student government offices in both high school and college.\\nIt’s ironic that Laura’s misfortune in marrying a man who lacked integrity eventually translated\\ninto a much better life for her and her children. Because ofhis transgressions, Laura was able to fully\\nutilize all her talents. The irony is that she always had more potential than her husband to excel in the\\nbusiness world.

Certainly this decision makes sense, given that the alternative is to leave their children with a\\nsignificant estate tax liability. The decision to share their wealth with their children is easy; the\\ndifficult decision is how to divide the capital.\\nAffluent parents who have younger children usually believe that the distribution of their wealth will\\nnever be a problem. They assume their assets will be distributed equally. Those parents with four\\nchildren, for example, typically state that “[their] wealth will be distributed equally among [their]\\nchildren—25 percent to each.”\\nThis simple distribution formula becomes more complex as the children mature. Parents of adult\\nchildren are likely to find that some of their children have a greater need for substantial financial gifts\\nthan others. Who should get more? Who should get less? These are questions everyone must answer.\\nNonetheless, affluent parents are likely to benefit from several important research findings:\\n♦ Parents with nonworking adult daughters and “temporarily” unemployed adult sons have a high\\npropensity to provide these children with heavy doses of economic outpatient care (EOC). These\\nchildren are also likely to receive a disproportionately large portion of their parents’ estates.\\n♦ The more economically successful offspring are likely to receive smaller levels of EOC and\\ninheritance.\\n♦ Many of the most highly productive sons and daughters receive no wealth transfers whatsoever. Yet\\nas we have discussed in Chapter 5, that’s one reason they’re wealthy!', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='HOUSEWIVES: A OR B?\\nMuch of the variation in gift giving among different children can be explained by occupation (or\\nsocioeconomic status) and gender. We have found that housewives have the highest propensity of all\\nmajor occupational groups to receive inheritances as well as periodic financial gifts from their parents\\n(see Tables 6-1 and 6-2). In fact, housewives are three times more likely to receive substantial\\ninheritances from their parents than are adult children of the affluent on average. In essence,\\nhousewives rank first in both the size of their inheritances and the incidence of inheriting wealth from\\ntheir parents. They are also most likely to receive significant financial gifts on an annual basis.\\nWe have identified two distinct types of housewife-daughters of the affluent—we’ll call them Type\\nA and Type B. Both benefit to different degrees from their parents’ beliefs that nonworking women\\nmust have “money of their own,” that the economic deck is stacked against women, and that sons-in-\\nlaw can never be fully trusted to provide support for their wives and children.\\nThe Type A housewife differs significantly from her Type B counterpart. Type As tend to marry\\nhigh-income-producing, successful men. They tend to take leadership roles in caring for their elderly,\\nsometimes disabled, parents. The gifts and inheritance they tend to receive are, in part, compensation\\nfor these efforts—efforts their working brothers and sisters are more likely to shy away from.

They are seen as intelligent, strong leaders and advisors and are frequently consulted\\nabout important family matters, such as estate and retirement planning, the sale of a family business,\\nand the choice of professional service providers. Type As are also conversant with estate tax laws.\\nThey are likely to encourage their parents to reduce the size of their estate, and thus minimize the\\nestate tax, by providing gifts to their children. Type A housewives receive substantial cash gifts\\nthroughout the early and middle stages of their lives, often from the time they are married. Later, gifts\\nare associated with the purchase of a home and, in some situations, the purchase of investment real\\nestate.\\nThe presence of a Type A housewife is of great benefit to affluent parents as well as to their other\\nadult children, since Type As often carry the enormous burden of providing for the emotional and\\nmedical needs of their elderly parents.\\nType B housewives, in contrast, are viewed as adult children who need economic outpatient care\\nand even emotional support. They tend to be dependent on others and are unlikely to be leaders in any\\ncapacity. Type Bs tend to marry men who are not likely to produce high incomes. They tend to be less\\nwell educated than the women in the Type A category. The parents of Type B housewives often\\nsubsidize their daughters’ household income in order to help their daughter’s family maintain a\\nminimum middle-class lifestyle. Type B housewives tend to live in close proximity to their parents.\\nThey often accompany their mothers on shopping trips. It’s not unusual for middle-aged Type B\\nhousewives to receive clothing allowances from their affluent mothers and fathers. Parents also care\\nfor their Type B daughters via provisions in wills/estate plans. They are provided with cash gifts and\\ninheritance because their parents believe they “really need the money.” In essence, Type Bs are cared\\nfor by their parents instead of the other way around.\\nThe parents of Type B housewives tend to hold back from distributing substantial cash gifts to their\\ndaughters out of fear that their daughters and their husbands may be poor money managers. Thus, cash\\ngifts for Type B housewives tend to be on a need basis, such as when Type B’s husband is “between\\njobs” or when there is a birth in the family. Gifts are often precipitated by crises and may range from\\ndirect cash payments to clothing and tuition reimbursement. Nonetheless, Type Bsreceive the bulk of\\ntheir parents’ wealth in the form of inheritance.

In some\\ncases, the level of compensation is substantially higher than the objective labor market would\\nindicate. In other words, the son-in-law in these situations is earning more as an employee of his in-\\nlaws’ business than he would working for an objective third party.

But even daughters who are employed in\\nhigh-status occupations are more likely to receive cash gifts and inheritance than their economically\\nsuccessful brothers. Why? As stated previously, affluent parents feel rather strongly that women, even\\nworking women, must have “money of their own.” They also contend that their sons-in-law “can never\\nbe fully trusted … to remain loyal … [to] support [and] protect” their daughters.

In 1980, fewer than 40,000 women had\\nannualincomes of $100,000 or more. In 1995, approximately 400,000 women were in this income\\ncategory. This translates into a tenfold increase. By the year 2000, more than 600,000 women will\\nhave incomes in the six-figure-and-higher category. But, again, as in 1995, there will still be five men\\nfor every woman in this income category.\\n♦ Women have made significant progress in regard to the proportion who graduate from professional\\nschools. In 1970, for example, only 8.4 percent of medical school graduates were women. In 1995,\\nnearly 40 percent were women. In 1970, women accounted for about 6 percent of all law school\\ngraduates; in 1995, they made up nearly 45 percent. A high-status occupational title does not\\nautomatically translate into a high income, however. A recent census headline stated: “Earnings gaps\\n[in 1995] still apparent even for professional degree holders.” In this regard, women employed in\\nprofessional occupations in 1995 earned only 49.2 percent of what men in professional occupations\\nearned.\\n♦ How do the salaries of men and women in high-income-producing occupations compare? See the\\nresults of our analysis in Table 6-3. In twenty out of twenty of the highest income-producing\\noccupations, women on average earn significantly less than their male counterparts. For example,\\nfemale physicians earn only 52 percent of what male physicians earn, female dentists earn 57.4\\npercent of what male dentists earn, female podiatrists earn 55 percent of what male podiatrists earn,\\nand female lawyers earn 57.5 of what male lawyers earn.\\n♦ In 1980, approximately 45 percent of the women in the six-figure-and-higher income category did\\nnot work. Conversely, 55 percent earned $100,000 or more via employment. These percentages have\\nnot changed appreciably since 1980, nor are they likely to change through the year 2005. In sharp\\ncontrast, nearly 80 percent of the men in this country who earn $100,000 or more are employed. Most\\nof the other 20 percent are over sixty years of age and retired.\\n♦ The vast majority of nonworking women who have annual incomes of $100,000 or more inherited\\ntheir wealth and/or received substantial financial gifts from their parents, grandparents, and/or\\nspouses. Their income is typically generated from interest, dividends, capital gains, net rental income,\\nand such.\\nTABLE 6-3\\nMEAN ANNUAL EARNINGS: MEN VS. WOMEN IN THE TOP TWENTY HIGH-INCOME-\\nPRODUCING OCCUPATIONS', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='♦ Women own nearly one-third of the small businesses in America. However, approximately two-\\nthirds of these businesses have annual revenues of under $50,000.\\n♦ Working women are more than four times more likely to leave the workplace than are working men.\\nThe objective data make it quite clear. In America, the odds are against women earning high\\nincomes. Some of this variation in income can certainly be explained by biases in the economic\\nmarketplace. But biases alone do not fully explain the fact that there are five men for every one\\nwoman in the top 1 percent of the earned income distribution. Could it be that the tendency for\\naffluent parents to subsidize their daughters is helping to perpetuate this inequality?\\nDaughters of wealthy couples tend not to have careers of their own. Why? In the past twenty years,\\nthe affluent population has typically been composed of one type of household: More than 80 percent\\nhave been married couples with children in which the wife did not work full time. What message did\\nthis send to the daughters of such couples? Simply stated: “Mother did not work (and the marriage', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='survived), so perhaps I should not work.” It is difficult to argue with such logic. The traditional\\naffluent family system does, in fact, function quite well. Affluent couples have a divorce rate that is\\nless than half the norm.\\nThe “father works, the mother mothers and does everything else for her family” system is very\\noften copied by the female products of such marriages. Many affluent parents actually encourage their\\ndaughters not to work, not to have their own careers, and not to be economically and psychologically\\nindependent. Affluent parents instill this “dependence” characteristic in their daughters over time with\\nsubtle cues. Thus, many affluent parents communicate messages such as the following to their\\ndaughters:\\nDon’t worry…. If you don’t want to have a career of your own, … you don’t have to\\nworry about money. We will help you out financially…. If you do have a career, … if you do\\nbecome a big success … and become independent, you will not be receiving any major\\nfinancial gifts or inheritance from us.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='THE WEAK AND THE STRONG\\nANN AND BETH: HOUSEWIVES AND DAUGHTERS\\nAnn is thirty-five years of age. She is the younger daughter of a couple we’ll call Robert and Ruth\\nJones. Her parents are millionaires. Mr. Jones owns and operates several businesses in the distribution\\nindustry. Mrs. Jones is a traditional housewife. She never completed college and has never been\\nemployed outside the home. She is, however, active in several noble causes in her community. When\\nher children were young, she served on the PTA.\\nHer daughter Ann is very candid about her relationship with her parents:\\nIt would be so easy … to take money from my parents … for the house, … for private\\nschool tuition…. But it always comes with strings…. My sister [Beth, age thirty-seven]\\nlearned that…. She does not lead her own life…. She has learned that the dole comes with a\\nprice … do it Mother’s way.\\nAnn understood the components of the parental control equation early on. When she was first\\nmarried, she and her husband sought employment out of town. She insulated herself from her parents’\\ninfluence by putting more than one thousand miles between herself and them.\\nAnn gave up her own career after her second child was born. But unlike her sister, Beth, Ann never\\naccepted economic outpatient care from her parents. Ann became sensitive to the real cost of being on\\nthe dole by observing her sister’s experience.\\nAccording to Ann, Beth and her family live in “subsidized housing.” Mr. and Mrs. Jones made a\\nsizable down payment on Beth’s home. They also dole out thousands of dollars to Beth each year for\\nhousingand other expenses. She receives $20,000 in cash from her parents every Christmas. Beth lives\\nless than two miles from her parents. (One of the proven ways that domineering parents control their\\nadult children is by living close to them.) Ann reports there is some confusion about home ownership\\nbetween Beth and her parents. It seems that Mother is always at Beth’s—invited or not. And Mother\\nwas more involved with the choice of Beth’s home than Beth was.\\nBeth married and became a mother before completing college. She and her husband lived with her\\nparents for three years after they were married. This gave her husband an opportunity to complete\\ncollege. Neither worked, even part time, during this period.\\nBeth’s husband completed college and accepted an administrative position with a regional\\ncorporation, but after less than two years his position was eliminated. He then accepted a position as\\nvice president of administration in his father-in-law’s business. According to Ann, the vice president\\nof administration was a newly titled position. The former title was office manager. But, as Ann\\nexplained, the job pays very well, and “you should get a load of the splendid fringe-benefit package.”\\nIt is difficult under such conditions for Beth and her husband to develop much self-confidence.\\nAnn’s parents, especially her father, do not show respect for Beth’s husband. According to Ann, they\\nalways felt he was socially, economically, and intellectually Beth’s inferior. They demonstrate much\\nmore respect for Ann’s husband, who graduated with honors from a prestigious college and earned a', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='master’s degree with distinction at the age of twenty-four. Robert and Ruth constantly tell their\\nfriends and relations of the great accomplishments of “our Ann’s husband.”\\nRobert and Ruth rolled out the red carpet for Ann’s future husband the first time he paid them a\\nvisit. They were very impressed with his academic credentials. Ann reported that during this brief\\nstay, Beth’s husband, then a boarder with his in-laws, acted much like a waiter. Father-in-law Robert\\nwould direct his son-in-law to mix and serve drinks and snacks, for example. After several cocktails\\none evening, Robert referred to his son-in-law as a “bozo.” Ann and her beau were shocked. This\\ntreatment left a lasting impression on the couple. Ann pledged that she and her husband would never\\nbecome “bozos” in her parents’ eyes. To date, she has kept her pledge. This is the case eventhough\\nAnn’s parents pressure her unrelentingly to accept economic outpatient care. In contrast, Robert and\\nRuth regularly ask Beth’s husband to do chores for them. They treat him more like a handyman and\\nchauffeur than the man who married their older daughter.\\nWhy does Beth’s husband tolerate this situation? Because he has been conditioned to do so. He and\\nBeth have a high-consumption lifestyle congruent with that of his in-law’s. Yet their ability to sustain\\nsuch a lifestyle is a function of their being controlled. Robert and Ruth have communicated a central\\nmessage to Beth, not so much in words as in deeds:\\nBeth, you and your husband are not capable of generating enough income on your own to\\nmaintain your ascribed station in life. You are economically handicapped. You and your\\nhusband need our special brand of economic outpatient care.\\nAre Robert and Ruth correct that Beth and her husband would be unable to achieve in life without\\nassistance? An objective third party would contend that they are. But what would the same objective\\nthird party say if he had examined this situation from its origin? He might have concluded that Robert\\nand Ruth made a special effort to prove their hypothesis. After even just a few years of receiving\\naggressive and overbearing economic outpatient care, Beth and her husband have lost much of their\\nambition, economic self-confidence, and independence. No one will ever know if this couple could\\nhave functioned productively on its own. Beth and her husband were never given this opportunity.\\nThe role of enlightened parents is to strengthen the weak. Robert and Ruth did just the opposite.\\nThey weakened the weak and continue to do so today. Not surprisingly, they never appreciated their\\nrole in causing much of the dependency Beth and her husband experience today. Today Ann has some\\nresentment, even bitterness, toward her parents. She holds them responsible for creating the economic\\nand emotional dependency that her sister and brother-in-law must deal with every day. Ann has\\nlearned much from Beth and her husband’s experiences.\\nAnn is especially sensitive about her parents’ role in usurping control of her sister’s children. In\\nthem, the mistakes of the past are likelyto be repeated. Ann can only wish that her parents had\\nfollowed some simple rules about raising children to be independent. They can’t now. But Ann can.\\nIt’s not too late for her. Ann will never allow her parents to control any portion of her life or the lives\\nof her husband and children.\\nCINDERELLA SARAH\\nSarah is an executive in her late fifties. Her parents were affluent. Her father started his own business', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='when she was quite young. When we interviewed her, Sarah was extremely candid about her\\nrelationship with her “Papa” and sister.\\nSarah’s father was a very strong-willed individual. His views about the role of women in our society\\nwere at odds with Sarah’s. He felt that women should be educated in the fine arts and then marry, have\\nchildren, and never work outside the home. Women, according to Papa’s dictates, were not to have\\ncareers of their own. They were to be supportive—even subservient—to their husbands.\\nAs a teenager, Sarah enjoyed debating Papa on numerous topics, including the role of liberated\\nwomen in our culture. Often these debates turned into arguments centered on how Sarah would spend\\nthe rest of her life. Papa frequently threatened his defiant daughter with the loss of financial support\\nfor her college education, dowry, and so forth.\\nIn spite of these threats, Sarah left home when she was a young woman. Her papa made good on his\\npromise and withheld all financial support. Yet Sarah never lost her determination to become\\nfinancially and emotionally independent from her parents. After leaving home, she became a\\nproofreader for a large publishing company. During her career in the publishing industry, she rose to a\\nvery senior position. Eventually she married, but only after her own career was well established.\\nSarah was distinctly different from her sister, Alice. Unlike Sarah, Alice, a Type B housewife, filled\\nthe role that Papa had assigned her. She was clearly “Papa’s girl.” Papa’s girl married a local\\ngentleman, a fellow from a lower social stratum who had a high propensity to spend but little\\npropensity to earn an income. In light of this fact, Papa placed Alice, her low-income-producing\\nhusband, and their three children on his own special brand of financial outpatient care. Papa would\\nnever allow his favorite daughter to live in a home or neighborhood that was incongruent with his own\\nupper-middle-class image. He heavily subsidized the purchase of a home and accessories for Alice\\nand her family. Significant cash gifts and gifts of securities were bestowed upon “Papa’s girl”\\nannually.\\nGiven these liberal subsidies, one might predict that Papa’s girl would have accumulated a\\nconsiderable amount of wealth. In fact, she and her husband accumulated very little money during all\\nthe years they were on outpatient care. Their budgeting system was quite simple: Spend more than you\\nearn and more than you receive in cash gifts. The balance will be absorbed by Papa.\\nAll during this time, Sarah, like many executives (see Table 6-4), received no outpatient care from\\nPapa. Instead, she was punished for her audacity in violating the strict doctrines Papa had set for her.\\nWhen Papa passed away, Alice received no more annual outpatient care, although his favorite\\ndaughter did receive the bulk of what was left of his wealth. Sarah received a much smaller amount.\\nShe was surprised that she received any part of her father’s estate, especially since he had told her\\nshortly before his death that she would “receive a lot less than Sister.” In his mind, his liberated and\\nvery independent daughter had much less need for an inheritance than did her sister, a Type B\\nhousewife.\\nIt did not take many years for Alice, the favorite daughter, and her husband to spend nearly all of\\nPapa’s money. Shortly thereafter, Alice passed away. How did her children survive? Their own father\\ndid not have enough income to maintain their upper-middle-class lifestyle. Who provided for them?\\nWho paid for their college educations? None other than their aunt, the recipient of no outpatient care,\\nthe semi-disinherited Cinderella Sarah. During all the years her father had supported her sister, Sarah\\nhad never hardened or demonstrated any animosity toward Alice. Sarah never forgot to send a little\\ngift to Alice on her birthdays. She never forgot to send Christmas and birthday presents to Alice’s\\nchildren. Sarah is, in fact, a very successful, independent, compassionate woman.\\nToday, Sarah is a self-made millionaire. She is in charge of her own family’s finances and is in the\\nprocess of setting up trust funds for her sister’s children and future grandchildren. Sarah feels this is\\nimportant. Regarding Alice’s daughters, she told us: “They know nothing about money.” How could', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='they? Their role models were their parents, typical UAWs.\\nTABLE 6-4\\nCORPORATE EXECUTIVE—GIFTS AND INHERITANCE: CONTRASTS AMONG THE\\nADULT CHILDREN OF THE AFFLUENT\\nSarah is a prodigious accumulator of wealth. Even today she is frugal and very well disciplined as a\\nconsumer. Her net worth is many times higher than her annual salary as an executive. Sarah told us:\\nPeople would be astonished to know how much money I have accumulated…. I know how\\nto hold on to it.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Like many wealthy people, Sarah is in the process of subsidizing the incomes of others, the products\\nof underaccumulating, overconsuming parents.\\nPeople often ask us how offspring of the same parents can differ so much when it comes to\\naccumulating wealth. How could Sarah and her sister be so different? We are convinced that some\\ndifferences exist at birth. Much of the difference, however, can be explained by variations in how\\nparents relate to each of their children.\\nPapa encouraged Sarah to become a prodigious accumulator while fostering the opposite trait in her\\nsister. In essence, he strengthened the strong daughter while weakening the weaker one. When Sarah\\nleft home, she burned her bridges. She received no outpatient subsidies. She had no choice but to learn\\nhow to “fish” for herself. And she taught herself very well. At the same time, her sister became\\nprogressively more dependent on Papa for his money.\\nSarah had compassion for her parents, particularly Papa. He sacrificed much and worked extremely\\nhard to become an affluent business owner. Papa was determined that his children would not have to\\nwork so hard and have to face the risk of “doing on their own.” But the willingness and ability to work\\nhard, take risks, and sacrifice were the qualities that made him a successful and affluent business\\nowner. Somehow, like many of his peers, he forgot how he became wealthy.\\nMany parents say there is nothing wrong with providing outpatient care. This is true, perhaps, if the\\nrecipients are already well disciplined and have demonstrated that they are able to generate a decent\\nliving without other people’s money. For example, what effect would accepting some outpatient care\\nhave had on Sarah once she had taught herself how to succeed, then excel at her chosen field? The\\nanswer is probably very little. She was mature enough, strong enough, to deal with money, hers or\\nanyone else’s.\\nThe real tragedy is the helplessness of those who come to depend onoutpatient care. Without Aunt\\nSarah’s kindness, her nieces would likely be terrified of the future. Luckily for them, Sarah is helping.\\nWiser than Papa, she will provide trusts for these young women. Such financial support will benefit\\nthem much more in the long run than would substantial gifts of cash. Some of the funds in the trusts\\nAunt Sarah is setting up for her nieces are earmarked for education. The rest will not be distributed\\nuntil these young women demonstrate considerable maturity. Sarah defines maturity as the proven\\nability to earn a good living. It is not her intention to create another generation of “weak sisters.” Still,\\nSarah is very realistic about her sister’s children. She realizes it is very difficult for teenagers to\\nreorient themselves. It is unclear if her teenage nieces will one day become strong, independent\\nwomen like their Aunt Sarah. It may be too late. They may have already been too heavily socialized in\\nthe consumption and dependent lifestyle they experienced at home. Fortunately, Sarah is a strong role\\nmodel. She is confident she can have a positive impact on the behaviors and personalities of her\\nnieces. Moreover, the compassion and love Sarah gives her nieces cannot be measured in dollars.\\nWhat did Sarah really want from her own papa? Much more than money, she wanted his love and\\nrecognition of her splendid achievements. Today Sarah has few regrets. She never dwells on the past\\nexcept when speaking of her father. Although Sarah still feels she was never recognized by her father,\\nshe will tell you that she capitalized on this need. Much of Sarah’s ambition and drive stem from the\\nneed to have her achievements recognized by others. So it is with many Cinderellas who turn some\\nadversity in their early lives into lifetimes of achievement.\\nTHE UNEMPLOYED ADULT CHILD', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Like Type B housewives, unemployed adult children are significantly more likely to receive annual\\ncash gifts from their parents than are their working siblings. In fact, our research findings regarding\\nthe incidence as well as the actual dollar amounts of gifts received are likely understated, since about\\none in four male children (twenty-five to thirty-five years of age) resides with his affluent parents, and\\nsome respondents did not perceive this living situation as gift giving/receiving. Male adult children,\\nby the way, are more than twice as likely to live at home than female adult children.\\nOften the unemployed have a history of being in and out of work. Others are so-called professional\\nstudents. Typically, their parents view these children as needing the money more than their brothers\\nand sisters do, now and in the future. Thus, the unemployed are more than twice as likely as their\\nworking brothers and sisters to receive inheritances.\\nOften the adult child in this category has close emotional as well as economic ties to his parent. He\\nis significantly more likely to live in close proximity to his parents—down the street, perhaps, or even\\nin the same home. It is not unusual, especially among unemployed adult male children, for the child to\\nact as the household handyman, assistant, or errand boy.\\nThe unemployed adult often receives his first cash gift when he shows signs of being unable to\\nmaintain or uninterested in maintaining full-time employment. Some young adults who receive\\nsubstantial cash gifts move back home upon graduation from college or graduate school. Others\\nreceive substantial cash gifts for housing, food, clothing, tuition, and transportation. The parents often\\npay for medical care and health insurance as well. Many of these cash gifts come from over-funded\\ncollege tuition savings plans. When the adult children decide not to continue their educations, there\\noften is a substantial amount of money that is legally theirs. This money is often used to help them\\nmaintain a comfortable lifestyle.\\nUnemployment during the early stages of adulthood is related to unemployment at later stages in\\nlife. Many unemployed middle-aged sons and daughters receive direct cash subsidies, often annually.\\nFurther, the incidence of unemployment is associated with larger and more frequent gifts. These adult\\nchildren are also more likely than their brothers and sisters who are employed to receive inheritances\\nin the form of personal real estate.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='BEFORE AND AFTER YOU’RE GONE\\nFor one of our focus group interviews, we asked a recruiter to supply us with eight to ten millionaires\\nfor the three-hour session. All were supposed to be PAWs and to have a minimum of $3 million in net\\nworth. We also instructed our recruiter that the millionaires had to be sixty-five\\nyears old or older. Each was to receive $200 for participating.\\nTwo days before the interview, nine millionaires had been recruited. But on the morning of the\\ninterview, our recruiter telephoned to tell us that one of them would not be able to participate. The\\nrecruiter said that she would likely be able to find a substitute. Just an hour before the interview, the\\nrecruiter telephoned us again to say she had found a sixty-two-year-old recruit. He was a business\\nowner with a high income, but he did not fit the strict definition of a PAW. Nevertheless, we agreed to\\ninclude him. The decision proved fortuitous.\\nThe substitute respondent, “Mr. Andrews,” was not told beforehand that the other respondents were\\naffluent. Perhaps that was why he took the lead in bragging about how he was “very well-off\\nfinancially.” In reality, Mr. Andrews had a high income but a relatively small net worth. He was a\\nclassic UAW who looked and acted the part. He wore gold bracelets on each wrist and had an\\nexpensive-looking diamond-encrusted watch and several rings. When Mr. Andrews began telling the\\ngroup his story, he exuded confidence. But after three hours of talking with eight wiser men, his\\ndemeanor changed. His confidence seemed to deteriorate as the interview progressed. We believe Mr.\\nAndrews learned some important lessons that day about financial planning and the intergenerational\\ndistribution of wealth.\\nMr. Andrews told us that he was already well-off and had already achieved his financial goals. But\\nwhen questioned, he could not articulate his goals. A major part of his plan was to earn a high income.\\nHe always assumed that “most of the other parts” of his financial plan would “take care of\\nthemselves.” We have interviewed many UAWs like Mr. Andrews. No matter how we ask them about\\ntheir financial goals, their responses are predictable:\\nDo you know how many celebrities live in my neighborhood?\\nI make a lot of money.\\nI live two houses away from a rock star.\\nMy daughter married a guy who earns a tremendous income.\\nWhat do UAWs such as Mr. Andrews tend to emphasize in telling us about themselves? Their\\nincome, consumption habits, and status artifacts. PAWs speak of their achievements, such as their\\nscholarship and how they’ve built their businesses. You will notice that Mr. Andrews, the UAW, has a\\nmuch different financial orientation than the eight PAWs who participated in our focus group\\ninterview.\\nSeveral of the more senior respondents reflected on their experiences in unusually great detail. We\\ndon’t think this information would have flowed so easily if it had not been for the initial comments\\nmade by Mr. Andrews. His views—so different from the others’—prompted an exchange that resulted\\nin the PAWs providing valuable advice on such issues as gift giving, the role and selection of\\nexecutors, conflicts among heirs, trusts, and the pros and cons of “controlling children and\\ngrandchildren from the grave.”', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='We began our interview by asking:\\nWould you first tell us something about yourself?\\nAll nine respondents briefly introduced themselves. A typical response:\\nI’m Martin. I am married, same wife for forty-one years. I have three children. One is a\\nphysician, one is an attorney, and one is an executive. We have seven grandchildren. I\\nrecently sold my business. I am now active in several religious organizations and two that\\nhelp young people get started in business.\\nAll the respondents currently owned and managed their own businesses or had recently retired after\\nselling a business. All except Mr. Andrews, who was sixty-two, were in their mid-sixties to late\\nseventies. After the respondents briefly introduced themselves, they discussed their financial goals.\\nThe first to respond was Mr. Andrews:\\nBeing in business for myself… When I wake up, every day is a challenge…. I plan my\\nwork … work my plan. It’s why my business is a good one.\\nMr. Andrews discussed his current gift giving and how his wealth would be distributed in the\\nfuture:\\nI have a son-in-law who is a physician…. Another is an attorney. They are well-off\\n[high-income generators]. They are both in the highest tax brackets…. They don’t need my\\nmoney.\\nBut their wives, my girls … my daughters, do. They are spenders…. Of course, I have\\nalways spoiled them rotten, and I’m paying for it now…. They call and ask me to pay for\\ntheir kids’ pianos and I buy pianos…. Bicycles and birthday parties … I pay for them, too. I\\nenjoy giving them money.\\nMy daughters are the beneficiaries of all my life insurance policies, more than enough to\\ntake care of all my estate’s taxes and expenses. The girls are left with the balance.\\nAfter I am gone, it makes no difference to me how they dispose of my money…. [They]\\ncan keep it, shoot craps with it, … but I just want them to be happy.\\n“Happy” to Mr. Andrews means having money to spend. And pride is having daughters who are\\nmarried to high-income generators. He spoke repeatedly about these issues.\\nSeated next to Mr. Andrews was Mr. Russell, a very wealthy retired gentleman who had recently\\nsold his manufacturing business. Immediately following Mr. Andrews’s admission that he spoiled his', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='daughters, Mr. Russell moved forward in his chair and made the following statement:\\nI have three daughters…. All have careers. All are working…. All are happy. All live a\\nlong way from here. They have their own lives to live…. I’m not worried about paying for\\ntheir futures…. Nor are they. We don’t discuss it. But there will be a large sum…. Plenty,\\nI’m sure, left over after I pass away.\\nAnother respondent, Mr. Joseph, nodded his head and stated:\\nWe have two daughters, one is a vice president for a large corporation and the other is a\\nscientist…. We are very proud of them…. They will be very well provided for. But as a\\nfamily, we don’t spend much time thinking about my estate.\\nMr. Russell and Mr. Joseph have the correct formula. If you are wealthy and want your children to\\nbecome happy and independent adults, minimize discussions and behavior that center on the topic of\\nreceiving other people’s money.\\nFollowing these statements, one of the other respondents asked Mr. Andrews about the disposition\\nof his business. His comments generated a series of interesting remarks from the more senior\\nmembers of the group. Mr. Andrews stated:\\nAll the money I’ve been making in my business I dedicate to my daughters and their\\nchildren…. 7 don’t need the money. The kids can use it. I give the maximum within the\\nbounds of the law.\\nWhat does Mr. Andrews plan to do about ownership of his business? Will he eventually sell it? Will\\nhe give it to the children to operate? Or does he have some other idea in mind?\\nI have an agreement with my oldest son. He is required to pay X amount of dollars each\\nyear, … and Billy will eventually own the business outright.\\nSeveral of the more senior respondents questioned this plan, since it clearly has the potential to\\ncreate conflicts among Mr. Andrews’s children. Mr. Andrews’s business is in the service/distribution\\nindustry; it does not have a great deal of value unless it continues to operate under the Andrews\\naffiliation. In other words, unless Billy Andrews keeps the business operating, there will be no\\nbusiness at all. Asked one respondent:\\nWould the business have significant value if you placed it for sale today?\\nMr. Andrews admitted that it would not. Then why is he requiring his oldest son and key employee', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='to purchase the business? Why notgive it to him? Remember, Mr. Andrews gives all of the profits of\\nthe business to his daughters. He also plans to give them the revenue he receives from the sale of the\\nbusiness—the money his son Billy pays for the business. Moreover, Mr. Andrews’s daughters already\\nreceive sizable cash gifts from their father. But not Billy. Billy, in his father’s estimation, needs no\\nsubsidies. He is extremely productive in generating income. He could always “carry a great deal on his\\nshoulders.” Mr. Andrews feels that his daughters, on the other hand, do not have the ability to\\nmaintain an upper-middle-class lifestyle by themselves. But what about his high-income-producing\\nsons-in-law?\\nIn Mr. Andrews’s mind, his sons-in-law will never generate an income high enough to support “the\\ngirls’” high-consumption habits. Also, he told us:\\nYou can never fully trust your sons-in-law…. Divorce is always a possibility.\\nWhat about future outpatient care for his daughters? Billy, Mr. Andrews’s surrogate, will provide\\nthe solution to this problem. Mr. Andrews’s plan calls for Billy to make the payments to his sisters for\\nyears after Mr. Andrews’s death. The money for these annual payments will come from the profits of\\n“his business.” Is this unusual? No. Business owners, entrepreneurs, and physicians often find\\nthemselves in similar situations (see Tables 6-5 and 6-6).\\nIn essence, Billy will be required to heavily subsidize his sisters’ lifestyle, a lifestyle predicated on\\nconspicuous consumption. Mr. Andrews feels “fairly certain” that Billy will carry out his father’s\\nwishes. Perhaps he will. But how would you respond to this plan if you were Billy’s wife? Think for a\\nmoment. Your husband is paying for his sisters’ expensive clothing, luxury automobiles, vacations,\\nand so on. Most spouses feel that charity begins at home. Note that spouses are often the initiators of\\nfamily conflicts regarding inequities in the distribution of wealth.\\nThe other participants did not criticize Mr. Andrews’s plan directly. When each spoke, he looked at\\nthe group in general, not at Mr. Andrews. Yet it became increasingly clear as the discussion\\nprogressed that the other respondents rated the Andrews Plan a poor one.\\nOne senior respondent reflected on a related situation:\\nTABLE 6-5\\nENTREPRENEUR–GIFTS AND INHERITANCE: CONTRASTS AMONG THE ADULT\\nCHILDREN OF THE AFFLUENT', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='TABLE 6-6\\nPHYSICIANS-GIFTS AND INHERITANCE: CONTRASTS AMONG THE ADULT CHILDREN\\nOF THE AFFLUENT', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='A son grew impatient with his father The son wanted to take over his father’s business,\\nbut he did not wish to wait for Dad to pass away. So the son opened his own business and\\nactually competed with his father’s.\\nMr. Andrews quickly countered:\\nMy son signed a noncompete contract with me…. Everything in a family is based on\\ntrust, isn’t it?', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='The participants seemed to think about this statement for a moment. Perhaps Mr. Andrews was having\\nsome second thoughts about his plan.\\nShortly after Mr. Andrews made this comment, he revealed that his children were the executors of\\nhis estate. Mr. Harvey then raised his hand and asked if he could respond. We were delighted. Mr.\\nHarvey was the oldest and wealthiest respondent in the group. He began by noting the importance of\\nfacilitating harmony among one’s heirs. And, according to him, the choice of executor(s) of an estate\\nwas critical in this regard. Mr. Harvey had served as executor or co-executor of several estates. He\\nunderstood full well that being an executor was a difficult task and that there was often animosity\\namong executors and the heirs of estates. For this reason, he had carefully chosen the executors of his\\nestate:\\nI have two children. They are close to each other. They can settle my estate between\\nthem…. But they will do it along with my attorney…. The children and my attorney are\\nexecutors of my estate. I put the attorney in just to keep the balance…. You know when\\nmoney’s involved what can happen. I want to keep good relations, … but good relationships\\nmay deteriorate at the last moment without an experienced professional.\\nMr. Andrews then spoke. He asked, with a hint of a challenge:\\nAre you really going to use someone from outside the family as an executor?\\nIn response, seven of the nine participants stated that, in addition to a family member, at least one\\noutsider would be co-executor of their estates. Mr. Ring, a retired entrepreneur and grandfather of nine\\ngrandchildren, was one such participant. Mr. Ring had served as co-executor of several estates. He\\nknew of situations in which the heirs to a grandparent’s fortune were seriously spoiled children in\\ntheir late twenties and thirties who did not have the training, discipline, or ambition to support the\\naffluent lifestyle they had been conditioned to enjoy. Several of these adults still lived at home. All\\nhad been receiving outpatient care from their grandparents. But, as Mr. Ring explained, once the “well\\nran dry,” problems arose. When the grandparents died, the grandchildren and parents became\\nadversaries. Each generation felt it should receive the bulk of the estate’s proceeds.\\nThese experiences had had a profound influence on Mr. Ring. He realized that long before one\\npasses away, one should select professionals to be co-executors. Consequently, over the years, he had\\ndeveloped close relationships with a highly skilled estate attorney and an outstanding tax accountant.\\nMr. Ring sought their advice before he retired, realizing that someday these professionals would likely\\nact on his behalf to prevent, or at least reduce, the probability that his grandchildren would battle over\\nhis estate. Through the years he had also sought their counsel on how to “give without spoiling.” Mr.\\nRing now gives gifts to his grandchildren, but not in the form of products or social privileges. And he\\nnever gives without first gaining the approval and blessings of his grandchildren’s parents.\\nThe trusts for the grandchildren are controlled…. Money is distributed only when each\\ngrandchild reaches certain maturity…. I was a little against it. But I listened to my lawyer', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='and tax man…. I don’t want to reach out from the grave to control them, … but the way the\\ntrusts are set up, my grandchildren will have to work.\\nMr. Ring’s heirs will not begin to receive their inheritances until they approach their thirties. While\\nsome affluent grandparents give their grandchildren products and privileges, the Rings give them\\neducations. Such gifts are intended to enhance their grandchildren’s discipline, ambition, and\\nindependence.\\nMr. Graham spoke next. He reflected on his own experiences as a co-executor, which had helped\\nhim select co-executors for his own estate.\\nYou have to use your judgment. You have to have understanding and compassion. I was\\nan executor of a [close friend’s] estate of a substantial amount of money. I had discretionary\\npower…. Every [decision] was not necessarily dictated….\\nWhen the daughter [age twenty-three] was ready to marry, … I knew her father would\\nhave wanted her to have a nice wedding … so we gave her … the kind of wedding he would\\nhave given her.\\nAfter she married and started a family, I was still not quite sure of her maturity. So I\\ndistributed only enough money for her to buy a nice home…. Later I was convinced that she\\nwas able to take care of herself… so I approved the distribution of what was left in the trust.\\nThe daughter received the balance of her inheritance just before her thirtieth birthday, when Mr.\\nGraham judged her to be capable of handling her inheritance. She had demonstrated her maturity in\\nher stable marriage, role as a mother, and career of her own.\\nWhen selecting the executors of his own estate, Mr. Graham chose an attorney who was an old\\nfriend. He discovered that “it’s better for the children to be mad at the arbitrator than with each other.”\\nMr. Ward, yet another affluent respondent, had also served as a co-executor. He chose two attorneys\\nas executors of his multimillion-dollar estate rather than his sons or daughters. One of the attorneys\\nwas his niece; the other, a partner in one of the top law firms in the country. Mr. Ward explained his\\nchoices:\\nI chose younger attorneys because I felt that they would have a better understanding of\\nthe needs of the heirs of my estate. Both have the greatest integrity and understanding, …\\nand the two of them know each other professionally.\\nBeyond understanding, empathy, and integrity, another characteristic was critical to Mr. Ward:\\nThe attorney who wrote [my] will was the one I selected as co-executor along with my\\nniece. I felt that if there was a dispute between my sons and sons-in-law … that he would be\\na good one to arbitrate. That’s the reason I selected him. He’s been a personal friend for a\\nlong time and a very successful businessman.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Mr. Ward’s comments are congruent with many of our research findings. First, most PAWs have\\nlong-term close relationships with several key professionals, such as top attorneys and accountants.\\nSecond, many people in Mr. Ward’s category have relatives and/or close friends who advise them\\nabout wills, trusts, estates, and gift giving. In fact, all things being equal, estates in which the heirs,\\ntypically the sons and daughters, are professional estate attorneys tend to be taxed less. Sons and\\ndaughters who are attorneys act as formal and informal legal advisors and opinion leaders for their\\naffluent parents. They have a significant influence over all aspects of estate plans, including the\\nchoice of the estate attorney, provisions in wills, the ultimate disposition of family assets, the choice\\nof executor(s), the use of trust services, and the incidence and size of the financial gifts to be given to\\nchildren and grandchildren.\\n“Attorney relatives” typically advise their affluent parents on how to minimize estate taxes via\\nannual gift giving to the children and grandchildren. Thus, the mere presence of a son or daughter who\\nis an attorney increases the probability that all the children in the family will receive substantial cash\\ngifts from their parents. (Consequently, these children inherit smaller amounts than the norm for all\\nchildren of the affluent, since much of the wealth in their parents’ estates is distributed to the attorney\\nand siblings prior to the death of their parents.)\\nWhat were all of these experienced respondents trying to tell Mr. Andrews? First, that his estate\\nwas complex, with many subjective provisions. He had acknowledged that his plan contained\\nnumerous verbal promises and monetary commitments. Mr. Andrews needed expert advice in how to\\nhandle these complex arrangements. He would be wise to consider having an estate attorney/arbitrator\\nas the co-executor of his estate. Otherwise, his estate plan could very well become the cause of much\\nconflict and animosity among his children.\\nBut what if Mr. Andrews is like many other under accumulators of wealth we have interviewed? In\\nthat case, he is not likely to establish close and long-term working relationships with professionals\\nsuch as attorneys. Remember that Mr. Andrews stated that he needed no outsiders to help him because\\n“I trust my children…. It is all based on trust.” But trust is not the only element in such situations.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='RULES FOR AFFLUENT PARENTS AND PRODUCTIVE\\nCHILDREN\\nThe affluent who have successful adult children have given us much valuable information on how they\\nraised them. Here are some of their guidelines:\\n1. Never tell children that their parents are wealthy.\\nWhy is it that many of the adult children of UAWs are more likely to earn high incomes than to\\naccumulate wealth? We believe one of the major reasons is that as children they were constantly told\\ntheir parents were wealthy. Adult UAWs tend to be the product of parents who lived in ways they\\nthought appropriate for wealthy people to act. They lived the high-status/high-consumption lifestyle\\nso popular in America today. It’s no wonder their sons and daughters attempt to emulate them.\\nConversely, adult PAWs whose parents were wealthy have told us time and time again:\\nI never knew my dad was wealthy until I became executor of his estate. He never looked\\nit.\\n2. No matter how wealthy you are, teach your children discipline and frugality.\\nAs you may recall, in Chapter 3 we profiled Dr. North, a wealthy man whose adult children live frugal,\\nwell-disciplined lives. Dr. North detailed how he and his wife raised their children. Simply stated,\\nthey taught by example. Their children Were exposed to credible role models whose lives were\\ncharacterized by their discipline and frugality. Dr. North said it best:\\nKids are very smart. They will not follow rules that their parents themselves do not\\nfollow. We [my wife and I] were well-disciplined parents…. We lived the rules … we taught\\nby example…. They [the children] learned by example.\\nThere must be congruency between what parents tell their children to do and what we as\\nparents do. Kids are very perceptive in pointing out inconsistencies.\\nDr. North received a birthday gift from one of his daughters when she was twelve. It was a poster\\ntitled “The King’s Rules.” On it, his daughter wrote down the rules that her father preached to his\\nchildren. Dr. North still keeps this poster in his office, prominently displayed behind his desk.\\nKids are looking for discipline and rules. She honored me with the poster. Kids must be\\ntrained to take responsibility for their actions. Today all my children are well disciplined\\nand frugal. They adhered to the rules. Why? Because their parents did…. Actions speak', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='louder than rules that are just words, not actions.\\nWhat were some of the rules Dr. North’s twelve-year-old daughter listed on the poster?\\n♦ Be tough … life is. In other words, there is no promise of a rose garden.\\n♦ Never say “poor me” … [or] feel sorry for yourself.\\n♦ Don’t walk on the back of your shoes…. Waste not, want not. In other words, don’t abuse your\\nbelongings. They will last longer.\\n♦ Close the front door…. Don’t waste your parents’ money letting the heat out.\\n♦ Always put things back where they belong.\\n♦ Flush.\\n♦ Say “yes” to those who need help before they ask.\\n3. Assure that your children won’t realize you’re affluent until after they have\\nestablished a mature, disciplined, and adult lifestyle and profession.\\nOnce again, Dr. North said it best:\\nI have set up trusts for my children … some estate tax advantages. But my plan will not\\ndistribute money to my children until they are forty years of age or older. Because in this\\nway my money will have little effect on their way of life at that age. They will have already\\nadopted their own lifestyle.\\nDr. North also told us that he never gives his children cash gifts, not even now that they are adults.\\nCash gives them too many options, … especially in the case of young children. Media,\\nespecially TV, controls the values of our young. Just like they try to control what we think is\\nfunny with canned laughter…. [There’s] too much emphasis on consumption…. I have never\\njust given cash for this reason. What I have always told my children [is] if you need to make\\na major purchase, you first must fund a good bit of it yourself.\\n4. Minimize discussions of the items that each child and grandchild will inherit or\\nreceive as gifts.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Never make light of verbal promises: “Billy, you will get the house; Bob, the summer cottage;\\nBarbara, the silver,” especially in a group setting, especially when consuming alcohol. You may too\\neasily forget or confuse who gets what, but the kids are not likely to forget. They will hold you and\\ntheir siblings responsible for being shorted. False promises often lead to discord and conflicts.\\n5. Never give cash or other significant gifts to your adult children as part of a\\nnegotiation strategy.\\nGive because of love, even obligation and kindness. Adult children often lose their respect and love\\nfor parents who submit to high-pressure negotiating tactics. Coercion of this type is often the product\\nof the manner in which parents negotiate with their young children. Even preteens aretaught the\\nbenefits of “Johnny got a bike so I should get a wagon.” Johnny and his brother should receive\\nsymbols of love and kindness but, instead, they learn that Mom and Dad must be pushed, squeezed,\\nand coerced into giving. The boys may begin to view each other as adversaries.\\nOften parents perpetuate conflicts even among their adult children. Have you ever told one of your\\nchildren or grandchildren something like the following:\\nWe helped your brother remodel his house/sent his kids to private school/paid his health\\ninsurance. We want you to have a few extra dollars. Would $5,000 be all right?\\nWhat’s wrong with such offers? Often those on the receiving end view them as signs of guilt or\\nappeasement on the part of their parents.\\n6. Stay out of your adult children’s family matters.\\nPlease note, parents, that your vision of the ideal lifestyle may be diametrically opposed to that of\\nyour adult son or daughter, as well as that of your son-in-law or daughter-in-law. Adult children resent\\ninterference from their parents. Let them run their own lives; ask permission even to give advice. Ask\\npermission also when contemplating giving significant gifts to your children.\\n7. Don’t try to compete with your children.\\nNever boast about how much money you have accumulated. This sends a confusing message. Often\\nchildren can’t compete with their parents on this basis, and do not really want to. You don’t have to\\nboast of your achievements. Your children are wise enough to appreciate what you have accomplished.\\nNever start a conversation with “When I was your age, I already had …”\\nTo many successful, achievement-oriented children of the affluent, accumulating money is not the\\nsuperordinate goal. Instead, they want to be well educated, to be respected by their peers, and to\\noccupy a high-status position. For many of these sons and daughters, the variations in income and\\nwealth among occupations are much less important than they are for their parents. The typical first-\\ngeneration affluent American is a business owner. He has a high net worth but often low self-esteem.\\nThe low-status, high-net worth parent often livesvicariously through his well-educated adult children', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='who occupy highstatus professions. Ask a self-made millionaire a simple question: “Mr. Ross, tell me\\nabout yourself.” A prototypical multimillionaire (a high school dropout) recently answered this way:\\nI was just a kid, a teenager, when we got married … never finished high school. But I\\nstarted a business…. Today I’m very successful, got dozens of college graduates, my\\nmanagers, working for me.\\nBy the way, did I mention that my daughter will graduate with honors from Barnard\\nCollege?\\nThis same millionaire never wanted any of his children to be entrepreneurs. And, in reality, most of\\nthe children of the affluent never do become business owners. Money is second or third on their list of\\ngoals and achievements.\\n8. Always remember that your children are individuals.\\nThey differ from each other in motivation and achievement. Try as you may via economic outpatient\\ncare, inequalities will exist. Will economic outpatient care reduce these differences? It’s unlikely.\\nSubsidizing underachievers tends to enhance differences in wealth, not reduce them. This, in turn, can\\ncause discord, since high-achieving brothers and sisters may resent such gift giving.\\n9. Emphasize your children’s achievements, no matter how small, not their or your\\nsymbols of success.\\nTeach your children to achieve, not just to consume. Earning to enhance spending should not be one’s\\nultimate goal. This is what Ken’s father always taught him. Majoring in finance and marketing, Ken\\nreceived an MBA with distinction. His father was a physician and a full-fledged member of the PAW\\ngroup. He often told Ken:\\nI am not impressed with what people own. But I’m impressed with what they achieve. I’m\\nproud to be a physician. Always strive to be the best in your field…. Don’t chase money. If\\nyou are the best in your field, money will find you.\\nKen’s father lived by these beliefs. He lived well below his means and invested wisely. As Ken tells\\nit:\\nMy dad bought a new Buick every eight years. He lived in the same house for thirty-two\\nyears. Simple house, nice house, less than an acre. Four bedrooms for six people, two\\nbathrooms … one for Mom and Dad and the other shared by four children.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='What was it that Ken’s father admired most about his son?\\nFirst, that I worked part time as a busboy in a pancake restaurant throughout my high\\nschool years. Second, that I never asked him for money. He volunteered to lend me a few\\nthousand dollars to start a business—right out of undergraduate school. Third, I sold the\\nbusiness with enough profits to fund my graduate school education completely … and never\\nhad to ask for a subsidy.\\nKen’s focus today is on achievement. He is a key executive with a major communications and\\nentertainment corporation. He is also an astute investor in both commercial real estate and quality\\npublic corporations. Also like his father, Ken is a prodigious accumulator of wealth. He lives in a\\nmodest home and drives used cars.\\nHis dad was a great role model and mentor to his son. But Ken also believes that his early\\nexperience as a busboy had a big influence on him:\\nI got to see the masses … how the other people lived. I saw how hard people had to work\\nto support their families … long, long hours at minimum wage just to get by. Money should\\nnot be wasted … no matter how much I earn.\\n10. Tell your children that there are a lot of things more valuable than money.\\nGood health, longevity, happiness, a loving family, self-reliance, fine friends … if you\\n[have] five, you’re a rich man…. Reputation, respect, integrity, honesty, and a history of\\nachievements!\\nMoney [is] icing on the cake of life…. You don’t ever have to cheat or steal … don’t\\nhave to break the law … [or] cheat on your taxes.\\nIt’s easier to make money honestly than [dishonestly] in this country. You will never\\nexist in business if you rip people off! Life is the long run.\\nYou can’t hide from adversity. You can’t hide your children from life’s ups and downs.\\nThe ones who achieve do so by experiencing and conquering obstacles, … even from their\\nchildhood days. These are the ones who were never denied their right to face some struggle,\\nsome adversity. Others were, in reality, cheated. Those who attempted to shelter their\\nchildren from every conceivable germ in our society … never really inoculated them from\\nfear, worry, and the feeling of dependency. Not at all.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='THEY ARE PROFICIENT IN TARGETING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.\\nW\\nhy is it that you’re not wealthy? Perhaps it’s because you are not pursuing opportunities that exist\\nin the marketplace. There are significant business opportunities for those who target the affluent, the\\nchildren of the affluent, and the widows and widowers of the affluent. Very often those who supply the\\naffluent become wealthy themselves. Conversely, many people, including business owners, self-\\nemployed professionals, sales professionals, and even some salaried workers, never produce high\\nincomes. Perhaps it’s because their clients and customers have little or no money!\\nBut, you may say, you have told us that the affluent are often frugal. Why target those who are not\\n“big spenders”? Why focus on people who are sensitive to the price variations in products and\\nservices? The affluent, especially the self-made affluent, are frugal and price-sensitive concerning\\nmany consumer products and services. But they are not nearly as price-sensitive when it comes to\\npurchasing investment advice and services, accounting services, tax advice, legal services, medical\\nand dental care for themselves and family members, educational products, and homes. Since the\\nmajority of the affluent are self-employed business owners and managers, they are also purchasers of\\nindustrial products and services. They are consumers of everything from office space to computer\\nsoftware. Also, the affluent are not at all frugal when it comes to buying products and services for\\ntheir children and grandchildren. Nor are the children of the affluent frugal when itcomes to spending\\nthe substantial gifts of cash that their parents and grandparents give them.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='FOLLOW THE MONEY\\nIn the next decade, there will be more wealth in this country than ever before. Opportunities to serve\\nthe wealthy will be greater than ever. Consider these facts about the American economy:\\n♦ In 1996, approximately 3.5 million households in America (out of a total of 100 million households)\\nhad a net worth of $1 million or more. Millionaire households accounted for nearly half of all private\\nwealth in America.\\n♦ During the ten-year period from 1996 through 2005, wealth held by American households is\\nexpected to grow nearly six times faster than the household population. By the year 2005, the total net\\nworth of American households will be $27.7 trillion, or more than 20 percent higher than in 1996.\\n♦ By 2005, the millionaire household population is expected to reach approximately 5.6 million. At\\nthat time, the majority of the private wealth in America ($16.3 trillion of $27.7 trillion, or\\napproximately 59 percent) will be held by the 5.3 percent of households that have a net worth of $1\\nmillion or more.\\nDuring the period from 1996 through 2005, it is estimated that 692,493 decedents will leave estates\\nworth $1 million or more. This translates into $2.1 trillion (in 1990 constant dollars). About one-third\\nof this amount will be distributed to the decedents’ spouses (in 80 percent of these cases, widows).\\nWidows will receive an estimated $560.2 billion, while the children of decedents will receive nearly\\n$400 billion (see Table 7-1). This translates into $189,484 for each of the estimated 2,077,490\\nchildren of decedents. People who receive wealth from the estates of affluent parents have a\\nsignificantly higher propensity to spend than others in their income/age cohort.\\nTABLE 7-1\\nESTIMATED ALLOCATIONS1 OF ESTATES VALUED AT $1 MILLION OR MORE ($\\nBILLIONS)\\nTABLE 7-2\\nESTIMATED FEES1 FOR ESTATE SERVICES ($ MILLIONS)', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Additionally, to minimize estate taxes, many affluent parents reduce the size of their estates by\\ntransferring much of their wealth to their offspring before death. During the ten-year period 1996-\\n2005, it is forecasted that living parents/grandparents will give their adult children and grandchildren\\nmore than $1 trillion. These gifts will be in various forms, including cash, collectibles, homes, cars,\\ncommercial real estate, public securities, and mortgage payments. This $1 trillion in gifts translates\\ninto more than $600,000 (in constant 1990 dollars) for each child of the affluent. This $1 trillion\\nfigure is a very conservative estimate, since, as statedearlier, by the year 2005, households in America\\nwith a net worth of $1 million or more will account for $16.3 trillion—or 59 percent—of the personal\\nwealth in America. The $1 trillion given to children and grandchildren thus represents a small portion\\n(6.3 percent) of this wealth.\\nMuch of this gift giving is tax-free. Typically, parents distribute their wealth so as to limit gift tax\\nliabilities. Each parent can give each child and grandchild up to $10,000 annually. Thus, a mother and\\nfather with three children and six grandchildren can give them $180,000 taxfree each year. Also note\\nthat gifts of tuition and medical expenses are typically not included in computations of gift tax\\nliability.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='BUSINESSES AND PROFESSIONS LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM THE\\nAFFLUENT\\nThere are many. Those who are specialists in solving the problems of the affluent and their heirs\\nshould be in great demand during the next twenty years.\\nATTORNEYS WHO SPECIALIZE\\nA father recently asked us about the ideal occupation for his son. At the time of this discussion, his\\nson was a second-year college student with a straight-A average. How did the father respond when we\\nsuggested that his son consider becoming an attorney? He said there were too many attorneys. We\\nreplied that there were too many law school graduates. There is always a demand for high-grade\\nattorneys. Attorneys who can generate new business are in even higher demand. The father asked\\nabout the areas of law that would be best suited for his son. We described three to him:\\nEstate Attorneys—Too Many?\\nThe first area we recommended was estate law. During the ten-year period 1996–2005, attorneys’ fees\\nassociated with settling estates in the $1 million or more category will total an estimated $17.1 billion\\n(see Table 7-2). Many attorneys will also earn revenue by acting as executors or co-executors as well\\nas administrators of estates. Attorneys will participate as executors or administrators for only a\\nfraction of the estates worth $1 million and more, but even a fraction of the estimated $22.3 billion in\\nexecutors’ fees and $16.9 billion in administrators’ fees translates into high profits for enlightened\\nestate attorneys.\\nIn essence, estate attorneys will likely generate more than $25 billion in revenue from servicing\\nestates in the $1 million or more range during the 1996–2005 period. This figure is greater than the net\\nincome generated by all law partnerships for all services in 1994! Of course, this total is only a small\\namount compared with the nearly $270 billion that will be paid to the federal government in estate\\ntaxes during the same ten-year period (see Table 7-1).\\nThere is more to being a successful estate attorney than just providing legal advice. The more\\nsuccessful ones also act as mentors and family advisors to the affluent and their heirs. These attorneys\\nhave to be especially adept at meeting the needs of the widows and widowers who are their clients.\\nWithin the affluent married-couple population, almost all husbands and wives intend to leave their\\nestates to their spouses, since a husband or wife can inherit his or her spouse’s estate without paying\\nan estate tax.* This unlimited marital deduction essentially postpones payment of estate taxes until\\nthe death of the second spouse.\\nAffluent widows face a particularly difficult situation. More than half will have been married to the\\nsame spouse for more than fifty years. Between 1996 and 2005, there are likely to be four affluent\\nwidows created for every one affluent widower. Age is most significant in explaining this variation.\\nWithin the millionaire married-couple population, the expected average age of a male decedent\\n(husband) is seventy-five and a half years, while the average age for a female decedent (wife) is\\neighty-two years. Moreover, males in such cases typically marry women who are on average two years\\ntheir junior. Thus, in the typical affluent-couple population, the husband who passes away at the age of', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='seventy-five and a half years leaves behind a widow who is two years younger than he was at the time\\nof death. His wife, who became a widow at the age of seventy-three, is expected to live until she is\\neighty-two. Most women in this scenario never remarry. Therefore, most women are widowed for nine\\nyears before their deaths.\\nIt is estimated that during the ten-year period from 1996 to 2005, nearly 296,000 women in the\\nmillionaire married-couple population will become widows. Their average inheritance will be\\napproximately $2 million (in 1990 dollars). During this same period, nearly 72,000 men from this\\npopulation will become widowers. It is estimated that these men will inherit more than $125 billion,\\nor an average inheritance of approximately $1.7 million.\\nIn what states will the demand for estate attorneys be the strongest? We predict that demand in\\nCalifornia, Florida, New York, Illinois, Texas, and Pennsylvania will be especially high during the\\nnext decade (see Tables 7-3 and 7-4).\\nOn Income and/or Wealth\\nWhich is the number-one income-consuming category among the affluent? Income tax. The affluent\\nin the $200,000-and-more annual realized income category account for only about 1 percent of U.S.\\nhouseholds but pay 25 percent of the tax on personal income. They will want to become better at\\nrealizing less income in the future.\\nWhat will happen in the year 2005, when millionaire households will control 59 percent of\\nAmerica’s personal wealth? The government will likely place increased pressure on the affluent,\\npossibly by creating innovative ways to tax wealth in addition to income. This prospect, according to\\nour surveys of millionaires, is foremost on the minds of the affluent. Paying increasingly higher taxes\\nto cover government spending and reduce the federal deficit is among the greatest fears of the affluent\\npopulation. Several states already have a wealth tax. Each year residents in such states must list all the\\nfinancial assets they own; a tax is levied on stocks, bonds, time deposits, and so on. How difficult\\nwould it be for our federal government to tax wealth this way? Not too difficult, since it already\\nknows how some states tax capital before it becomes realized income.\\nWe believe that in the next twenty years, the affluent will have to use every option within the law to\\nremain affluent. It is a segment of our economy that will be under siege by the liberal politician and\\nhis friend, the tax man. Surely the affluent will readily spend their money for legal advice that will\\nhelp them withstand the siege. The tax attorney will prove to be an integral part of the defense. Thus,\\nthe second area of law we recommended to the father for his son was tax law.\\nTABLE 7-3\\nPREDICTED NUMBER AND VALUE1 OF ESTATES OF $1 MILLION OR MORE', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='TABLE 7-4\\nPREDICTED NUMBER OF ESTATES VALUED1 AT $1 MILLION OR MORE RANK\\nORDERED BY NUMBER OF ESTATES BY STATE FOR THE YEAR 2000', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='For Sale: A Place in America\\nThe third area of law we recommended was immigration law. Attorneys who specialize in\\nimmigration law are likely to benefit from predicted developments in this area. For example, it will\\nbecome progressively more difficult to immigrate to this country and become a naturalized citizen. At\\nthe same time, the demand for American citizenship will increase greatly, especially among affluent\\nforeigners. Consider how millionaire entrepreneurs and advocates of free enterprise living in Taiwan\\nfeel about their future. China also wants their capital and country.

She asked the question we are\\nmost frequently asked:\\nWho are the affluent?\\nBy now you probably can predict the answer. Most of the affluent in America are business owners,\\nincluding self-employed professionals. Twenty percent of the affluent households in America are\\nheaded by retirees. Of the remaining 80 percent, more than two-thirds are headed by self-employed\\nowners of businesses. In America, fewer than one in five households, or about 18 percent, is headed by\\na self-employed business owner or professional. But these self-employed people are four times more\\nlikely to be millionaires than those who work for others.\\nThe reporter followed with the next logical question:\\nWhat types of businesses do millionaires own?\\nOur answer was the same one we give everyone:\\nYou can’t predict if someone is a millionaire by the type of business he’s in.\\nAfter twenty years of studying millionaires across a wide spectrum of industries, we have concluded\\nthat the character of the business owner is more important in predicting his level of wealth than the\\nclassification of his business.\\nBut no matter how hard we try to make our point, reporters want to keep things simple. What a\\ngreat story, what a great headline, it would make if they could tell readers:\\nHere are ten businesses millionaires own!\\nWe have gone out of our way to emphasize that there are no sure steps one can take to become\\nwealthy. Too often reporters ignore the facts. They sensationalize and twist our research findings. Yes,\\nyou are more likely to become affluent if you’re self-employed. But what some of these reporters', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='don’t tell you is that most business owners are not millionaires and will never come close to becoming\\nwealthy.\\nWe do tell reporters that some industries tend to be more profitable than others. Thus, those who\\nown businesses in the more profitable industries tend, by definition, to realize more income. But just\\nbecause you’re in a profitable industry does not guarantee that your business will be highly\\nproductive. And even if your business is highly productive, you may never become wealthy. Why?\\nBecause even if you earn big profits, you may spend even bigger amounts on nonbusiness-related\\nconsumer goods and services. You may have been divorced three times or have a habit of gambling on\\nthe horses. You may not have a pension plan or own any shares in quality, publicly traded\\ncorporations. Perhaps you feel little need to accumulate wealth. Money, in your mind, may be the\\nmost easily renewable resource. If you think it is, you may be a spender and never an investor.\\nBut what if you’re frugal and a conscientious investor and you own a business that is profitable? In\\nthis case, you’re likely to become wealthy.\\nIt is easier to earn higher profits in some industries than others. We identify several of these\\nprofitable industries in this chapter. But again, we caution readers not to oversimplify our findings and\\nsuggestions. Too often people want a “sound-bite” answer to the question of how to become wealthy\\nin America. Even worse are those who distort our data-based findings. Consider, along these lines, the\\nmessage that was recently left for us by a business broker:\\nI thought you would like to know that someone has printed a brochure stating that you\\nare a professor at Stanford University and that you found that 20 percent of the millionaires\\nin America are dry cleaners…. Is this true?\\nFirst, neither one of us ever taught at Stanford. Second, neither of us has ever stated that one in five\\nmillionaires is at this moment pressing shirts. We did find in the mid-1980s that dry cleaning was a\\nprofitable small-business industry. But again, profits don’t automatically translate into affluence or\\naccumulated wealth. This is like those sons of ours and perhaps yours who thought they would make\\nthe varsity basketball team because they bought a pair of Air Jordan shoes. A label does not make a\\nvarsity player. Nor does an industry label make the business owner wealthy. It takes talent and\\ndiscipline to generate profits and ultimately wealth. That is why we are offended by people who tell\\nthe American public:\\nJust buy my educational/study-at-home kit and your new business venture will be a\\nsuccess. Start your own business today—you will be wealthy tomorrow. I did it in this\\nindustry. You can do it, too! It’s so easy!\\nAgain, it’s not the kit, not the idea, not the industry. For example, the profitability data for\\nhardware/lumber retail establishments twenty-five years ago never got us excited. They didn’t\\nconvince us to invest in a business of this type. But think what the founders of the highly profitable\\nHome Depot did. They reinvented the industry. They did not allow industry standards for profits, sales\\nvolume, or overhead to dictate how they operated their business and invested their money. These\\nfounders had tremendous talent, discipline, and courage. They became wealthy and helped make a lot\\nof their employees and other investors financially independent. Most people who make it big in\\nbusiness set their own very high standards.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='ONLY CHANGE IS PREDICTABLE\\nThings do change, even in the so-called owner/manager business envi-ronment. Take, for example, the\\nindustry we mentioned previously—dry cleaning. (In fact, the appropriate title is laundries, dry\\ncleaning, and garment services.) With regard to this industry, Tom Stanley reported in 1988:\\nIn 1984 there were 6,940 partnerships; 91.9 percent have net income, while the average\\nreturn on receipts (net profit as a percent of receipts) was 23.4 percent (Thomas J. Stanley,\\nMarketing to the Affluent [Homewood, I11.: Irwin, 1988, p. 190]).\\nWhat about the profitability of this industry in the 1990s? We analyzed the IRS’s federal income\\ntax return data. In 1992, we determined that there were 4,615 partnerships; only 50.5 percent had any\\nnet income, while the average return on receipts was 13 percent. Also in 1992, there were 24,186 sole-\\nproprietorship dry cleaners in America. What was their average net income? On average, it was\\n$5,360. This placed dry cleaners 116th out of 171 sole proprietorships based on average net income\\ncriteria. The industry at that time ranked 119th in return on receipts, which equaled 8.1 percent. What\\npercentage of dry cleaners generated a net income? Nearly three in four, or 74.1 percent, made at least\\none dollar of net income. In this regard, dry cleaning ranked 92 out of 171 industries analyzed.\\nWhat a difference eight short years can make. But the dry cleaning industry is not the only one to\\nencounter such changes. The data in Table 8-1 contrast selected industries. You will notice that\\nseveral have experienced significant changes in profitability over the years. The number of men’s and\\nboys’ clothing and furnishings stores, for example, more than doubled from 1984 to 1992. In 1984, all\\nof the sole proprietorships in that industry made a profit. But in 1992, only 82.7 percent were\\nprofitable. Its rank in this regard dropped from first to fifty-seventh among the 171 sole\\nproprietorships studied. The highway and street construction contractors industry moved from a\\nranking of 8 to 138, while coal mining moved from 14 to 165.\\nMany external and often uncontrollable factors influence the profitability of industries and firms\\nwithin those industries. Often the presence of high numbers of profitable firms within an industry\\nattracts more and more people to the industry, which can have a dampening effect on profits. Changes\\nin consumer preferences can also affect profits. So can the actions of our government. If it had an\\nenergy policy that favored the use of coal, perhaps the number of sole-proprietorship coal mining\\nbusinesses would not have dropped from 717 to 76 in just eight years. Note that only 34.2 percent of\\nthe 76 coal mining businesses made a net profit. But in spite of this, sole proprietors in this business\\nearned an average net income of $196,618. Obviously a minority of coal mining operations owners\\nignore industry trends and standards, and many of these people have been rewarded for their tenacity\\nand contrary beliefs about the coal industry. Many successful business owners have told us that they\\nenjoy “short periods of rough times” in their chosen industries because they weed out much of the\\ncompetition. This seems to be the case in the coal mining industry. The 34.2 percent of the businesses\\nin the industry that were profitable had a net income of approximately $600,000.\\nTABLE 8-1\\nRANKINGS OF SELECTED CATEGORIES OF SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS ACCORDING TO\\nTHE PERCENTAGE WITH NET INCOME1: 1984 VS. 1992', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Many people ask us, “Should I go into business for myself?” Most people have no business ever\\nworking for themselves.

Why? Give credit to wealthy parents. They know the odds of succeeding in business. They\\nunderstand that most businesses are highly susceptible to competition, counter consumer trends, high\\noverhead, and other uncontrollable variables.\\nSo what do these millionaires advise their children to do? They encourage their children to become\\nself-employed professionals, such as physicians, attorneys, engineers, architects, accountants,\\nanddentists. As stated earlier, millionaire couples with children are five times more likely to send\\ntheir children to medical school than other parents in America and about four times more likely to\\nsend them to law school.\\nThe affluent know the risks and the odds of succeeding or failing in business. They also seem to\\nunderstand that only a small minority of self-employed professionals fail to make a profit in any given\\nyear, and that the profitability of most professional service firms is substantially higher than the\\naverage for small businesses in general. We will elaborate on these issues with hard numbers. But first\\nlet’s discuss the other attributes associated with being a self-employed professional.\\nFor a moment assume you are Mr. Carl Johnson, the sole proprietor of Johnson Coal. You’re the\\nowner of one of the twenty-six coal mining businesses that made a profit last year out of the seventy-\\nsix in the industry. Not long ago, 717 sole proprietors were still in your industry. More than nine of\\nevery ten made a profit. Now the industry has been reduced in number by 90 percent. But you’re\\ntough, you’re resourceful, and you’re intelligent. In spite of the withdrawal of most of the other\\noperators, you hung in there. Now you’re reaping the benefits. You made a net profit of $600,000 last\\nyear. And you’re doing well this year. Now you have two children in college who are outstanding\\nstudents. You begin to ask yourself some questions:\\n♦ Should I encourage my David and Christy to become involved in the coal mining\\nbusiness?\\n♦ Should I encourage them to eventually take over my parents’ coal mine?\\n♦ Is coal mining the best place for my children?\\nMost of the millionaire business owners we have interviewed would not encourage their children to\\ntake over such a business. This is especially true in cases in which the children are outstanding\\nstudents. They would suggest that David and Christy, the young scholars, consider other avenues.\\nMost businesses today require some investment in land, equipment, and buildings. The Johnson\\nCoal Mining business ownsmountains that contain coal. It owns millions of dollars’ worth of\\nequipment. It employs many miners and must constantly upgrade the safety of its operation. It must\\nconform to OSHA’s mandates. It must deal with the uncontrollable price the market places on a ton of\\ncoal. It must constantly be vigilant about competitors who are trying to steal its customers. It must\\nkeep a careful watch on changes in America’s energy policy. It also must keep its workers happy and\\nsafe. It must constantly deal with the possibility of a mine cave-in and halted production. Finally, the\\noperation is in a fixed location.

What if the uncontrollable factors drive you bankrupt next year? Can you use\\nyour skills to teach coal mining at the technical university? Probably not. Your skills are more hands-\\non, not intellectual.\\nWe once asked an affluent business owner who had fled Europe because of the Holocaust why all\\nhis adult children were self-employed professionals. His response:\\nThey can take your business, but they can’t take your intellect!\\nWhat does this mean? A government and/or a creditor can confiscate a business composed of land,\\nmachinery, coal pits, buildings, and so on. It can’t confiscate your intellect. What do professionals\\nsell? Not coal, not paint, not even pizza. What they sell most of all is their intellect.\\nPhysicians, for example, can take their intellect anywhere in America. Their resources are quite\\nportable. The same is true for dentists, attorneys, accountants, engineers, architects, veterinarians, and\\nchiropractors. These are the occupations held by a disproportionate number of the sons and daughters\\nof affluent couples throughout America.\\nWhat about the income characteristics of professionals as comparedwith the Johnson Coal Mining\\noperation? Only a minority of self-employed professionals have ever made as much as $600,000 profit\\nin a single year. And most self-employed professionals spend many years in training, which is costly\\nboth in dollars and time. Nevertheless, most affluent parents believe that the lifetime benefits\\nassociated with being a professional greatly outweigh the costs. Remember, most of these parents pay\\nall or a significant portion of their sons’ and daughters’ tuition and fees for training. Their vote is with\\ntheir hard-earned money.\\nHow will you vote? Notice that coal mining, on average, produced a higher net income ($196,600)\\nthan any of the sole proprietorships listed in Table 8-2. But what proportion of coal mining operations\\nmade any net income during the same period of time? Only about one in three (34.2 percent). This is\\nin sharp contrast with the percentages of profitable businesses in each of the professional service\\ncategories listed in Table 8-2. What percentages were profitable? About 87.2 percent of the offices of\\nphysicians, 94.9 percent of the offices of dentists, 92.5 percent of the offices of veterinarians, and 86.6\\npercent of the offices providing legal services.\\nAlso examine the average return on receipts. On average, it would take $2.4 million in receipts for a\\ncoal mining operation on average to generate a net income of $196,600 (approximately 8.2 percent of\\n$2.4 million in receipts). What about physicians? The average net income of a physician’s office is\\n$87,000—that’s 56.2 percent of the $154,804 receipts generated. With that kind of return on receipts,\\nhow many dollars in receipts would a physician’s office have to generate to earn the same average net\\nincome that coal mining businesses earned ($196,600)? Only $349,800, a far cry from the $2.4 million\\nrequired of coal mining operations. The figure’s even lower for osteopathic physicians; on average,\\nthey require receipts of $340,138 to earn the expected $196,600 in net income. Legal service\\nproviders, on average, would need to generate $414,800 in sales to earn what the average coal mine\\noperation earned in net income.\\nWhat will you advise David and Christy to do?

They all take pride in “going it alone.”\\nConsider what a multimillionaire once told us about being self-employed:\\nThere are more people [employees] today working at jobs that they don’t like. I’ll tell\\nyou honestly that the successful man is a guy who works at a job, who likes his work, who\\ncan’t wait to get up in the morning to get down to the office, and that’s my criteria. And I’ve\\nalways been that way. I can’t wait to get up and get down to the office and get my job under\\nway.\\nFor this fellow (a widower without children), it’s not the money. In fact, his estate plan calls for all\\nhis wealth to go to the undergraduate scholarship fund at his alma mater.\\nHow did this fellow and others like him select the businesses they wanted to start? He was well\\ntrained in college by engineering and science professors, many of whom were also entrepreneurs.\\nThese professors were his role models. Most successful business owners had some knowledge or\\nexperience with their chosen industry before they ever opened their own businesses. Larry, for\\nexample, worked for more than a dozen years selling printing services. He was the top performer for\\nhis employer. But after growing tired of the constant fear that his employer would go bankrupt, he\\nconsidered opening his own printing company. He sought our advice in this regard.\\nWe asked Larry a simple question: “What’s the number-one thing that printing companies need?”\\nHe immediately responded, “More business, more revenue, more customers.” Thus, Larry answered\\nhis own question. He did start his own business, but not his own printing company. He became a self-\\nemployed broker of printing services. He now represents several outstanding printing firms and', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='receives a commission on every sale he makes. His business has little overhead.\\nBefore starting his own business, Larry told us he did not have the courage to be an entrepreneur.\\nHe told us that every time he even thought about “going it alone” he encountered fear. Larry believed\\nthatthe self-employed were fearless, that fear never entered their minds.\\nWe had to help Larry adjust his thinking. We began by explaining that his definition of courage was\\nwrong. How do we define courage? Courage is behaving in a way that conjures up fear. Yes, Larry,\\ncourageous people, entrepreneurs, recognize the fear in what they are doing. But they deal with it.\\nThey overcome their fears. That’s why they are successful.\\nWe have spent a considerable amount of time studying courageous people. Certainly Ray Kroc had\\nenormous courage to think he could market food to the world. Remember that he was an ambulance\\ndriver on the front lines in World War I. So was Walt Disney. Lee Iacocca had to have enormous\\ncourage to tell Congress and the world that Chrysler would come back “big time.” He does not fit the\\nstrict definition of an entrepreneur, but in our minds he has entrepreneurial blood in his veins.\\nFear abounds in America. But, according to our research, who has less fear and worry? Would you\\nguess it’s the person with the $5-million trust account, or the self-made entrepreneur worth several\\nmillion dollars? Typically, it’s the entrepreneur, the person who deals with risk every day, who tests\\nhis or her courage every day. In this way, he learns to conquer fear.\\n* * *\\nWe saved the following case study for last, because in our minds it encapsulates the differences\\nbetween PAWs and UAWs. Throughout this book, we have stressed that the members of these two\\ngroups have distinctly different needs. PAWs need to achieve, to create wealth, to become financially\\nindependent, to build something from scratch. UAWs more often need to display a high-status\\nlifestyle. What happens when members of these two groups attempt to occupy the same space at the\\nsame time? As the following case study demonstrates, the likely result is conflict.\\nMr. W. is a self-made millionaire with a net worth conservatively estimated to be over $30 million.\\nA typical PAW, Mr. W. is the owner of several companies that produce industrial equipment, testing\\ninstruments, and specialty gauges. He is also involved in many other entrepreneurial activities,\\nincluding real estate ventures.\\nMr. W. lives in a middle-class neighborhood surrounded by people who have only a small fraction\\nof the wealth he has accumulated. He and hiswife drive full-sized General Motors sedans. His living\\nand consuming habits are quite middle class. He never wears a tie or suit to work.\\nMr. W. enjoys venturing into, as he calls it, luxury real estate:\\nI make money outside of the [equipment] business … in real estate…. God continues to\\nmake more people, but he doesn’t make any more land…. You will make money if you’re\\nsmart and you’re choosy where you pick the spot.\\nMr. W. is very picky indeed. He buys property outright or in partnership only when the price is\\nright. He typically purchases property or a part ownership from an owner and/or a developer who is in\\ngreat need of financial assistance.\\nRecently he uncovered yet another “superior investment opportunity in sun country”:\\nSome poor guy was putting together a luxury high-rise condominium…. For a builder to', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='build, he had to have 50 percent of the units sold…. So I went in and made a deal with him….\\n[I] bought all of the units of the same style … floor plan … with a lot of leverage, and he got\\nhis money. And he built. Because I bought all the one style, … anybody [who] wanted to buy\\nthat style had to see me…. Like monopoly, nobody else competes with me…. I sell ‘em all\\nright out, all but one.\\nBut Mr. W. does not even keep the one remaining unit for very long. He and his family use it for a\\nshort vacation or two. Occasionally, he invites his close friends to use it. Otherwise, he rents the\\nremaining unit until it is sold. Why doesn’t Mr. W. maintain a more permanent presence in these\\ncondominium complexes? It’s not his style.\\nMost of the people who buy Mr. W.’s vacation condominiums are upper-middle-class UAWs. Mr.\\nW. and many of the buyers of his condominium units have had a number of disagreements. In several\\nof the complexes where Mr. W. previously bought units, his buyers passed so many restrictive\\ncovenants that Mr. W. was uncomfortable even spending vacation time in his condominiums. Thus, he\\nfelt compelled to sell that “one remaining unit” in each of these complexes.\\nI have a dog…. Call him the six-figure doggie…. I have sold several condominiums\\nbecause … the people passed dog laws. [They told me,] “You know, you’ve got to get rid of\\nthe dog….” I’ll sell an entire building before I get rid of my dog.\\nMr. W. anticipated that the status-conscious buyers of his latest venture would also be insensitive to\\nhis desire to have a dog. So before construction on the complex was even started, he listed his dog in\\nthe building’s declaration. It stated that Mr. W. and his family would have the right to have a dog with\\nthem when they were in residence.\\nAll the buyers, according to Mr. W., were given copies of the declaration. Thus, they were all aware\\nof Mr. W.’s right to have a dog in the complex. Not one owner objected at the time they purchased\\nproperty. But shortly after the complex was completely sold out, excluding Mr. W.’s “last available\\nunit,” the owners banded together and formed an action committee. Its purpose was to develop and\\nenforce an expanded list of restrictive covenants. Certainly these new covenants would not restrict the\\nrights of Mr. W. and his dog? After all, these rights were specified in the original declaration.\\nThe action committee passed a dog law. It sidestepped the original declaration concerning dogs and\\nstated that dogs would be allowed on the complex, with certain restrictions, if they weighed less than\\nfifteen pounds. So much for doggie rights and original declarations. Mr. W. felt that this was a\\nsubterfuge to encourage him to sell out. His six-figure doggie weighed thirty pounds. He felt that even\\nif the dog dieted, it could not come into compliance. Mr. W. was particularly disturbed that he was\\nnever allowed to cast a vote for or against the dog-related covenant. Nonetheless, he was determined\\nto keep his dog in spite of the covenant. After all, he had been a major investor in the building before\\nconstruction even began.\\nThey [the action committee] wrote me a letter [and] stated that I had to get rid of the\\ndog because it was over fifteen pounds…. So I went to one of their meetings…. I complained\\nabout their voting system…. I had no representation.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='Just prior to leaving the meeting, Mr. W. addressed the committee:\\nHow do you know he’s over fifteen pounds? … How do you know? He could be hollow….\\nI won’t get rid of the dog.\\nA few days after the meeting, the head of the action committee cornered Mrs. W. while she was\\nwalking her dog. He told her in a legalese tone: “Get rid of the dog. You’re in violation of our\\ncovenant.” Later that afternoon, Mrs. W. told her husband what had transpired. She was noticeably\\nupset about the encounter. He advised her to stay calm.\\nSeveral weeks later, Mr. W. received a letter that demanded that he remove his dog. It also stated\\nthat legal action would be initiated if he did not comply with the dog-related covenant. Two more\\nletters followed. Each contained statements that were even more threatening than the first.\\nMr. W. was not impressed with these requests. The author of the letters was the chairman of the\\naction committee. He was also an attorney. But as Mr. W. discovered, the chairman was not licensed\\nto practice law in the state where the complex was located. Thus, Mr. W. “promptly ignored” each of\\nthe action committee’s demands.\\nHowever, Mr. W. and his family began to feel that they were out of place even just vacationing at\\nthis condominium complex. Was the action committee using the dog as leverage to evict his entire\\nfamily? Mr. W. was convinced this was the real issue. He and his family were not what some would\\nconsider to be “beautiful people.” In contrast, the complex was filled with (in Mr. W.’s parlance) the\\nbest-scrubbed condominium owners one could ever imagine.\\nMr. W. was growing increasingly angry with the members of the action committee. He felt that its\\nmembers were going out of their way to be rude to him. He was especially annoyed that the chairman\\nof the committee had embarrassed his wife in front of several other condominium owners, Mr. W.\\ndevised a plan.\\nAt a meeting of the condominium owners, at which all the members of the action committee were\\npresent, Mr. W. stood up and introduced himself.\\nI’m the guy that you have been sending letters to … about our dog…. I have given your\\nproposal some careful consideration…. I’ve decided I’m not going to get rid of my dog, nor\\nam I going to sell my condominium.\\nThis statement drew anticipated boos and hisses from the audience. After gaining the undivided\\nattention of his targeted audience, he outlined his counterproposal: to turn his condominium unit over\\nto his company’s profit-sharing and pension plan and allow assembly-line employees to use the unit as\\na vacation resort fifty-two weeks a year. He asked his audience: “Would that be okay with all of you\\nfolks?”\\nNumerous members of the audience moaned. They were undoubtedly envisioning Mr. W.’s blue-\\ncollar employees invading their space fifty-two weeks a year! Some attendees shouted out, “Keep the\\ndog, keep the dog!” The chairman of the action committee proposed that a committee meeting be held\\nimmediately in the adjoining conference room. Five minutes after this behind-closed-doors meeting,\\nthe committee members filed back into the room. The chairman told the audience of condominium\\nowners that the action committee had made a decision.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='“After reviewing all the elements of this situation, the action committee recommends that\\nthe W.s be allowed to keep their dog. I ask that the covenant be so amended. All in favor\\nNot long after this brilliant victory, the W.s sold their condominium unit. They did so because, as\\nMr. W. observed:\\nI don’t want to live in a building with people who don’t like dogs.\\nAccording to Mr. W., his dog was very important to him and his family. So much so that they sold\\nthe unit at a bargain price. They have sold other units in other complexes in which people were hostile\\nto their dog. So how much is that doggie in the condominium worth? To the W.s, it’s worth several\\nhundreds of thousands of dollars. That’s how much he estimates he lost in selling his units at below-\\ntrue-market value. A hostile environment, even in an atmosphere of beautiful people, is not a good\\nplace for dogs—or for prodigious accumulators of wealth.', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='T\\nhe cornerstone for The Millionaire Next Door was put in place in 1973, when I undertook my first\\nstudy of the affluent population. This book reflects the knowledge and insights that were gained from\\nthat initial study and from many studies of the affluent that followed. Most recently, my coauthor, Bill\\nDanko, and I conducted a survey from May 1995 through January 1996 that we consider to be most\\nrevealing. We underwrote the study ourselves. This allowed us to have complete control in focusing\\non the factors that explain how people become affluent in America.\\nAlong the road of gathering intelligence abut the wealthy, I have been assisted by truly\\nextraordinary people. Bill has been my most important and valuable “wing man” since the beginning\\nof this research. No one could ask for a better coauthor than Dr. Bill Danko.\\nI am indebted to my wife, Janet, for her guidance, patience, and assistance in the development of\\nthe early forms of the manuscript. A very special thank-you is accorded Ruth Tiller for her\\noutstanding job in questionnaire formatting, interview transcription, editing, and word processing. I\\nowe a deep debt of gratitude to Suzanne De Galan for her extraordinary work in editing the\\nmanuscript. I also wish to acknowledge the contribution of my children, Sarah and Brad, for their\\nassistance as student interns on this project.\\nFinally, I would like to acknowledge the thousands of people who have contributed to our work\\nthrough their candor, willingness, and interest in telling “their story.” They are truly the millionaires\\nnext door!\\nThomas J.

Professors Bill Holstein, Hugh Farley, Don\\nBourque, Sal Belardo, and others have consistently contributed to an atmosphere of collegiality at the\\nUniversity that allowed this work to come to fruition. And, for certain, if it weren’t for Bill and Don\\nbringing Tom Stanley to teach at the University in the early 1970s, this book and other fruitful efforts\\nby the Stanley/Danko team would never have come about.\\nThe laborious tasks associated with much of the empirical research necessary to complete the book\\nwere cheerfully completed under my direction by my three children, Christy, Todd, and David. Their\\ndiligence and attention to detail could not have been and was not motivated by a “fee for service.”\\nThey executed their tasks as if they had a true equity stake in the project. I trust that this exposure to\\nmarketing research will make them informed consumers when shaping their careers.\\nFinally, I must recognize and applaud my mother, who instilled in me discipline and faith.

Danko, Ph.D.\\nAlbany, New York', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='APPENDIX 1\\nHOW WE FIND MILLIONAIRES\\nHow do we go about finding millionaires to survey? A “C” student of ours once tried to answer this\\nquestion in a marketing research course. He suggested that we merely obtain a list of people who drive\\nluxury cars. As readers know by now, however, most millionaires do not drive luxury cars. Most\\nluxury car drivers are not millionaires. No, this method will not work!\\nTARGETING BY NEIGHBORHOOD\\nThe method used in our most recent study, as well as many others we have conducted, was developed\\nby our friend Jon Robbin, the inventor of geocoding. Mr. Robbin was the first to classify—or code—\\neach of the more than 300,000 neighborhoods in America. Using this system, one can code more than\\n90 percent of America’s 100 million households.\\nMr. Robbin coded these neighborhoods first according to the average income for each. Next, he\\nestimated the average net worth of each neighborhood by first determining the average interest\\nincome, net rental income, et. al. generated by households in each neighborhood. Then, using his\\nmathematical “capitalization model,” he estimated the average net worth that would be required to\\ngenerate such incomes. Once he had determined the estimated average net worth for each\\nneighborhood, he assigned each a code. A code of one was assigned to the neighborhood with the\\nhighest estimated average net worth; a two was assigned to the neighborhood with the next highest\\naverage net worth, and so on. (Also see Thomas J. Stanley and Murphy A. Sewall, “The Response of\\nAffluent Consumers to Mail Surveys,” Journal of Advertising Research [June/July 1986], pp. 55–58.)\\nWe use this estimated net-worth scale to help us find millionaires to survey. First, we select sample\\nneighborhoods that rank significantly higher than average along the estimated net-worth scale. A\\ncommercial mailing list company calculates the number of households in each of our chosen high-net\\nworth neighborhoods. Next, the list company randomly selects heads of households within the selected\\nneighborhoods. These are the people we survey.\\nIn our most recent national study, conducted from June 1995 through January 1996, we selected\\n3,000 heads of households. Each received an eight-page questionnaire, a form letter asking for his\\nparticipation and guaranteeing the anonymity and confidentiality of the data we collected, and a dollar\\nbill as a token of our appreciation, along with a business reply envelope in which to return the\\ncompleted questionnaire. A total of 1,115 surveys were completed in time to be included in our\\nanalysis. An additional 322 surveys could also be accounted for: 156 address unknown, 122\\nincomplete, and 44 otherwise usable surveys returned after data analysis had commenced. Overall, the\\nresponse rate was 45 percent. Out of the 1,115 respondents, 385, or 34.5 percent of the total, had a\\nhousehold net worth of $1 million or more.\\nTARGETING BY OCCUPATION', metadata={'source': 'book6'}), Document(page_content='We supplemented this survey with alternative surveys. Often we employ what is called the ad hoc\\nmethod, in which we survey a narrowly defined population segment, as opposed to people who live\\nwithin affluent neighborhoods in general.
